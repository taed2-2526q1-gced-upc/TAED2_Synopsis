Severe weather is perilous anytime, of course, but CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says that tornado conditions are more dangerous during the night. "Tornadoes can be more deadly when people are sleeping and not paying attention to the warnings," he said. Scattered storms will soak Illinois and Missouri, and wind and hail will continue to be moderate in those states, the National Weather Service said. By Thursday afternoon, storms will hit parts of Indiana and Kentucky. Earlier this week, severe weather struck the South. Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia reported large hail. Residents in Shawnee, Oklahoma, were awakened early Wednesday morning by a severe storm producing golf ball-sized hail. "The hail came out of nowhere so it was kind of shocking," Sherri McDonald said to CNN in an iReport.

The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru supporters were brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage: 'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-1-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. "This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit," the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. "Shots fired and the subject is down," the officer writes that Slager said. "He took my Taser." But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. "I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott," Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. "It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing," said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. "I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' " she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. "I ... thought about erasing the video," Santana told MSNBC's "All in With Chris Hayes" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. "I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger." The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that "no one can feel happy." "He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family," he told Holt. "But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that." Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. "I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw," North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: "No justice! No peace!" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a "Black Lives Matter" T-shirt who shouted, "This is what democracy looks like!" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. "We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that," Scott family attorney Stewart said. "I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature." If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he "sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body," and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: "In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there." When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. "There was not a struggle for the Taser," Anthony Scott said. "I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway." To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was "running for his life" away from the officer. "I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that," Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels "forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son." "He was a loving son, a loving father," she said. "He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son." Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Tony Marco, Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer and Evan Perez contributed to this report.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)China's cybercensors have long used a "Great Firewall" to block its citizens from reading critical articles from Western news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of. But it's no longer enough for them, says a study published Friday. They've developed a new IT weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders, including in the United States. The study's authors have named it the "Great Cannon," and it operates in plain sight. Going on the attack so visibly and handily within another country's borders will probably draw international ire, the study's authors say, and Beijing may have counted on that. "This is a powerful attack capability, and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the Chinese government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack," said researcher John Scott-Railton. The reason Chinese censors are taking that risk: Free-speech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the Great Firewall and give Chinese readers greater access to the West's free press. Enter the "Great Cannon." It blasts targeted Web servers with massive distributed denial of service attacks, and it uses the Web browsers of unsuspecting Web surfers to do it. The Cannon wrecked two online services with DDoS attacks in March, say the researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, the International Computer Science Institute, the University of California-Berkeley and Princeton University. Many of the researchers focus on the abuse of information technology to undermine civil liberties and human rights.  And they are afraid this new cyberweapon could easily be used for an array of powerful attacks beyond what they've already observed. "A modest technical change could turn the Great Cannon into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a Chinese server," Scott-Railton said. This might include all emails headed in and out of China, he said. "The device could replace genuine attachments with malicious files, for example." One of the Great Cannon's targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one -- Greatfire.org, run by Chinese expats bent on fighting Beijing's censorship. They monitor Chinese citizens' access to international news sites such as German news service Deutsche Welle or The Tibet Post. But the other target may seem odd at first glance. GitHub is a popular Silicon Valley hosting service used by programmers who want to share code with each other. The two attacks were connected, however, the study says. GreatFire.org hosted two GitHub repositories that contained computer code allowing Chinese readers to get around the Great Firewall and read The New York Times in Chinese. Critical articles from the Times are a particular fly in the ointment for Beijing, and China has turned away at least three of the paper's reporters in short succession, according to a U.S. congressional commission on China. GitHub said it thought the attackers were trying to coerce it into taking content offline. GreatFire.org says it suspects the attack may have been in response to a Wall Street Journal article on its struggle to circumvent Chinese censors. Both services suspected China was behind their attacks and used the Great Firewall to carry it out, according to statements and media reports. By triggering attacks and analyzing them, the researchers concluded that Beijing has developed a tool distinctly different from the Great Firewall. They are confident it is also in China and say it is technically similar to the Great Firewall. The firewall, in a manner of speaking, stands aside and watches all digital traffic going in and out of China, the researchers say. If it sees requests going out into the world for content it doesn't want citizens to see, the researchers say, it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the Chinese user's computer to make them stop communicating. The user might see an HTTP 403 reply -- "Sorry, you're not authorized to see this page." Not only does the Great Firewall monitor tons of traffic, but its systems have to do a lot of processing to discern what to block and what not, so it's work-intensive. The Great Cannon takes on a much lighter load, because it doesn't care about all that traffic. Instead, it targets traffic between a handful of Web addresses. But it uses Web traffic unrelated to its targets to build its attack against them. Users going to Baidu, one of China's most prolific Web services and most successful Internet companies, can become unknowing proxy warriors against the Great Cannon's targets, the study says. In the overwhelming number of cases, when traffic came into China from the outside world, the Great Cannon let it through to Baidu's advertising servers. But in a tiny fraction of the cases the researchers observed, it picked out computers it wanted to use in the attack, and sent bad code back to the user's browser. "The malicious script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting participant in the DDoS attack against GreatFire.org and Github," the authors wrote. Their browsers mercilessly fired requests at both sites and paralyzed them. "At the time of writing they number 2.6 billion requests per hour," GreatFire.org wrote during an outage in March. "Websites are not equipped to handle that kind of volume so they usually 'break' and go offline." GitHub said the March incident was the biggest DDoS attack in its history. Back then, the programmers noticed that there were unique aspects about the attack. "These include every vector we've seen in previous attacks as well as some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting, uninvolved people to flood github.com with high levels of traffic," they wrote. Baidu denies any involvement in the attacks and says its internal security has remained intact, the researchers said. But government cybercensors' monitoring of traffic to and from Baidu's servers could hurt its reputation as a major player in international commerce. Fully encrypting Web traffic should help to defend against the Great Cannon, Scott-Railton said. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a Communist Party hardliner, and since he took office in November 2012, Chinese citizens have felt the grip tightening again on freedoms they thought they had gained, journalists and activists say. Xi and the Politburo "are responding to new threats by falling back on repressive tactics" rather than "experimenting with more liberal policies," think tank Freedom House wrote in an analysis. And repression has particularly targeted grass-roots activists, online opinion leaders and ordinary citizens on the Internet. Xi also has a reputation for eyeing Western values with suspicion and considering American IT companies, such as Intel and Google, partners of the U.S. government. "Deployment of the GC (Great Cannon) may also reflect a desire to counter what the Chinese government perceives as U.S. hegemony in cyberspace," the researchers write. The authors say the United States and Great Britain already have methods for intercepting unencrypted traffic and launching attacks.</div></td></tr><tr>

A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace – prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled. No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression .

The frigate was then circle by a Russian maritime patrol craft . October 2014 - RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear aircraft over the North Sea and Russian warships pass through the Channel escorted by the Navy . October 30, 2014 - 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises are intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours. Jets are scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain . November 2014 - HMS Argyll monitors a heavily armed Russian warship as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel and Strait of Dover . January 2015 - Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth . February 17, 2015 - HMS Argyll intercepts a Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean in the English Channel . February 19, 2015 - Two RAF Typhoon jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort two Russian bombers in international airspace off the coast of Cornwall. April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise. The Nato naval operation – Exercise Joint Warrior – was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to ‘snoop’ on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a ‘resurgent’ Russia. He said: ‘This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. ‘We’ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn’t surprise me at all.’ He added that Britain should spend more on defence: ‘Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don’t have the manpower... we need resilience.’ A source added: ‘It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.’ Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may ‘poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland’ before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A Ukip MEP has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a ‘very strong leader’ who has ‘put Russia first’. Diane James, Ukip’s Justice Spokesman, also applauded Mr Putin's nationalist credentials and argued he was forced into invading Ukraine because of the European Union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked a row last year when he hailed Russian President as a ‘brilliant operator'. Scroll down for video . Praising Putin: Diane James, Ukip's Justice Spokesperson applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin's nationalist credentials . Taking part in a women leaders' debate on LBC radio, Mrs James - who is considered a potential successor of Nigel Farage - said: ‘Nigel went on record saying if you provoke the Russian bear you get a reaction. ‘I admire him from the point of view that he’s standing up for his country. He is very nationalist. ‘He is a very strong leader. He is putting Russia first, and he has issues with the way the EU encouraged a change of government in the Ukraine which he felt put at risk a Russian population in that country,' she said. Mrs James was the Ukip candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and currently represents the south east of England in the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage caused controversy in March 2014 after he admitted he admired Putin as a ‘brilliant operator’ for his stance on the Syrian conflict. However, unlike Mrs James, he clarified his view on Putin by adding: ‘Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ His comments followed the annexation of Crimea, but before the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russian-supported separatists. Mrs James told presenter Iain Dale (far left) that she admires Putin because he stands up for his country . Ukip smiles: Diane James is widely considered to be Nigel Farage's successor as the leader of Ukip . Mrs James' comments came as Ukip’s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a ‘rugby club on tour’ with members who can be ‘boorish’ and ‘chauvinistic’. Patrick O’Flynn, who is also the party’s economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to ‘work harder’ as it is ‘lagging’ behind with female voters. As he launched the party’s ‘policies for women’ alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and Mrs James, Mr O’Flynn was forced to defend its ‘blokeish’ image under Nigel Farage. Mrs James' comments come as Ukip's campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said the party resembled a 'rugby club on tour' He said: ‘Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. ‘But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. ‘We’re a very fast-growing party, we’re increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we’re not maximising our support in every potential group. ‘And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we’ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.’ The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a ‘tampon tax’. It also said it would give ‘absolute, full and unconditional’ support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are ‘properly resourced’. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is ‘accepted cultural practice’ for some of ‘our ethnic compatriots’. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party’s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on ‘lies’ and ‘myths’ spread about the party. She said: ‘I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. ‘There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. ‘Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.’ Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as ‘sluts’.

The medical incident officer joined the team caring for patients at Worcestershire Royal Hospital last Friday. It came as the West Midlands Ambulance Service demanded action following delays in treatment. The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust admitted circumstances were 'less than ideal'. A medical incident doctor, usually deployed to major disaster zones, was sent to help staff at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital's under-pressure A&E department, it has emerged . It came as the weekly national figures from NHS England showed it has missed the four-hour waiting time target for the 28th consecutive week, despite a slight improvement. The proportion of patients seen within the Government maximum of four hours at A&E departments in England is below the target of 95 per cent again - they have not been met since September 28. NHS England said 92.5 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge in the week ending April 12. This was a slight improvement on the previous week, when it was 92.4 per cent. The figures include data from last Friday, April 10, where the MIO was sent in to help at Worcestershire Royal Hospital after months of problems. A Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman apologised for last Friday's incident, and said it was 'working very hard' to prevent it from happening again. An A&E consultant at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital was one of five senior doctors who resigned from their jobs amid the crisis affecting emergency departments at two hospitals. In February four consultants from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch quit their roles, on the same day as their colleague at the Worcestershire Royal. It left Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust with the task of filling five vacancies in a matter of months as the doctors work their notice periods. In a damning open letter to the trust, four of the consultants branded the NHS trust a 'disgrace' and claimed they had been put under 'unbearable stress'. The 1,700 word letter, signed by Richard Morrell, Sarah Crawford, Christopher Hetherington and David Gemmell, said: 'The trust appears to tolerate massive overcrowding in the county's A&E departments. 'This is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all A&E staff. 'The situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times. 'We are battle-weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under.' The trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm that on Friday April 10, West Midlands Ambulance paramedics were asked to look after a number of patients in the corridor before they could be transferred in to the care of the A&E staff. 'While the A&E department were unable to allow the ambulance staff to hand over the patients, the A&E staff were aware of their conditions and we wish to assure people that no patients came to any harm.' The spokesman said the medical incident officer was brought in after concerns were raised by the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The spokesman added: 'Both the hospital and ambulance service are working under extreme pressures at the moment, due to a number of external factors. 'Regretfully these pressures have meant some patients being treated in less than ideal conditions and we accept this is not good enough and are working very hard to put this right. 'We are sorry for any distress caused to patients and their families. 'We now need to work together with the ambulance service and other partners to sort the situation out as soon as possible.' Ray Salmon, regional organiser for Unison, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the incident was not 'a new problem' and had 'been building up over a period of months'. He described the situation as 'completely unprecedented', and that the union members were 'furious'. He said: 'One of our reps went public just after Christmas and blew the whistle about the problems and the trust tried to exclude him from the premises, we had a massive argument about that and I reckon that since then the problem is getting even worse. 'Then last week when the ambulance service had to bring in their own doctor, well that was actually just completely unprecedented, it's really winding people up.' The trust said no patients came to any harm during last Friday's incident, but Mr Salmon said the situation was starting to affect patient care. The move came as staff were forced to treat patients in the hospital's corridors. (File image posed by model) He said: 'It's a combination of bad planning and it's also a combination of under-resourcing. 'We've been saying for years the Government hasn't put enough money in to the NHS. 'You listen to the politicians at the moment and the gloating about what a great job they've done over the last five years, and they're talking about what they're going to do over the next five years. 'But the situation is at the moment there's just not enough resources gone in, there's not enough staff, and that's affecting patients, it's totally unacceptable.' According to today's NHS waiting times figures, there were 443,274 attendances in A&E for the seven-day period, up slightly on the previous week when it was 441,099. The number of people waiting for more than four hours was 7,434 - slightly lower than 7,459 a week earlier. Similarly, the number of people waiting for more than 12 hours was 15 - down from 22 the previous week. Emergency admissions were 102,163, compared with 106,160 the previous week.</div></td></tr><tr>

Amanda Goff, known to her clients as Samantha X, is a former journalist wrote a book about her experience after becoming a global sensation. In her new book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, the 40-year-old said she was shocked her revelation garnered so much attention from the media, with interview requests flooding in from news organisations all over the world. After being labelled ‘a whore and a s*** and an anti-feminist’, Ms Goff said the most troubling part of her ‘coming out’ experience was the response she received from other mothers, who expected her children to ‘endure a life of misery’ because of her abnormal profession. Scroll down for video . Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . ‘The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ‘better’ mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my ‘poor, poor’ children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),’ she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become ‘old news’, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to ‘toughen up’ and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered. The mother-of-two said her harshest critics were other mothers concerned with the ‘life of misery’ her children were expected to endure . ‘The people who loved me knew who I was. I adored my kids, and my kids adored me. I was a good person, a good mum, a good friend.’ Ms Goff said she was glad she has been able to tell her story and reveal the ‘emotional turmoil’ and ‘torture’ she faced after she outed herself as an escort. She explained that among the negativity, she also received many messages of 'kindness' and 'support'. Some even told her they were inspired to leave their mundane jobs to pursue a career in the sex industry. Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Goff said she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been . ‘They want to thank me for going public and making them realise it was okay to like sex, and want to get paid for it,’ she said. Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones. Discussing her personal life, Ms Goff confirmed her ex partner and the father of her children had known about her x-rated career ‘for yonks’ and although he did not support it, she had never deceived him about it. Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity . Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X . Hooked: Amanda Goff reveals why she decided to out herself as a high-class escort and what happened after her big secret became a global sensation . Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia last year that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity. He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.' After cutting ties with her former flame and coming out as an escort, Ms Goff said Samantha X was inundated with requests and claimed she could have pocketed a ‘million dollars’ if she'd have seen every person who inquired. However, after enduring months of public scrutiny, Ms Goff said her time as an escort was coming to an end. She said that while she would miss the extravagant lifestyle, at this stage in her life, she had become more concerned with finding a long-term partner. ‘Samantha X is afraid of love,’ she revealed. ‘I am sick of being afraid. I am sick of sleeping alone.’ If you want to learn more about Amanda Goff's story you can read about it in her tell all book Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort.</div></td></tr><tr>

Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football’s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan . The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Pearce, Perch, Maguire; Boyce, Chow (Cowie 79), Kvist (Fortune 56), Bong, Bo-kyung; McClean, Pennant (McKay 68) Subs not used: Al Habsi, Taylor, McCann, Cowie, Barnett . Booked: Boyce, Bong, Fortune, McClean (sent off) Wolves: Kuszczak; Iorfa, Ebanks-Landell, Stearman (c), Golbourne; Edwards, McDonald, Price, Sako (Hause 82); Afobe, Dicko (Doyle 82) Subs not used: Flatt, Doherty, Henry, van La Parra, Jacobs . Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko . Scorer: Afobe 25 . Referee: J Linington . Attendance: 16,810 . The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan’s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England’s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season – but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett’s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive . Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop . Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay’s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club’s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players’ carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan’s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds – and the drop – and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell’s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply – and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan’s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett’s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle . Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands . However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe’s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire . Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan’s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.</div></td></tr><tr>

Shadow Cabinet ministers branded the industry leaders who signed an open letter backing the Conservative economic plan as members of the ‘1 per cent’. Lord Prescott, an adviser to Ed Miliband, went further, suggesting the signatories were ‘tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms’ – even though several were former Labour supporters. Business spokesman Chuka Umunna raised the stakes, suggesting that one, former Diageo boss Paul Walsh, should no longer take over as the head of the CBI. Mr Umunna said it would be ‘untenable’ for Mr Walsh to ‘claim to be independent in the light of this’. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the election, 103 corporate leaders yesterday declared that the Government ‘has been good for business and has pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’. Throughout the day, 17 more added their names, including the bosses of AstraZeneca, Citi Private Bank and Pirelli. ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk,’ they said.

Together, the businesses the executives run employ more than 600,000 people, and include brands such as Primark, Iceland, Pizza Express, Mothercare, Ocado, Moonpig, Ted Baker, Costa Coffee and LK Bennett. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride also put their names to the list. Chancellor: George Osborne said  Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented 'a huge risk to the British economy' Labour MPs’ attempts to brand them all fat cats were undermined by the fact that the signatories included 29 heads of firms with fewer than 250 employees. Some had supported Labour at previous elections. George Osborne said Tories were offering ‘business stability’, while Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented ‘a huge risk to the British economy and to British jobs’. The Chancellor said: ‘Corporation tax is the main tax on business. Increase it and you increase the tax on investment, on growth and on jobs. It is as simple as that.’ And he said there were ‘just 36 days left to save Britain’s economic recovery’. An Ipsos Mori poll of FTSE 100 leaders suggests 86 per cent will back the Conservatives. Under Tony Blair, 55 per cent backed Labour. Veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman claimed the letter indicated a ‘clear decline in British political life’, accusing the businesspeople of endorsing ‘right-wing policies that benefit them’. Last night Labour released its own list of names, backing a ‘Labour Government to put working people first’. It included dozens of workers who are on zero-hours contracts as well as advertising chief Trevor Beattie, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway and former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business leaders features several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They include Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing Labour in 2005. Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe appeared in a 2004 Labour broadcast. He said: ‘To change now, half way through a recovery from the worst recession we have had in my lifetime seems to be a madness. You need to get behind the people doing the job.’ Other former Labour supporters who signed the letter included: Surinder Arora, described as a ‘big fan’ of Tony Blair in 2007; Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a ‘seaside manifesto’ with Gordon Brown before the 2010 election; Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who made a donation to Labour in 1998’; and Moni Varma, who signed a letter to the Financial Times before the 2005 election backing Labour.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Ed Miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘blubbed’ while watching Pride, a British film released last year. It’s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history. Every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story, with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator. So what is it about, this heartwarming tale of British derring-do? The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners’ strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they’re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: ‘Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.’ I’m sure Pride isn’t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies — Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain’s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions’ greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn’t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video . Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London’s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg’s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments — both Conservative and Labour alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia — not to mention Colonel Gaddafi — to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories . The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause — in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham’s political message couldn’t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson — ‘Red Robbo’ — at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs — pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge . Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain’s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, ‘blub’? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain’s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers’ Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic — there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility — but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish £27 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain’s greatest postwar Prime Minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain’s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle’s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being ‘insufficiently British’ and said ‘although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country’. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making . The truth is, it’s the Left that doesn’t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire — ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set — than in the whole of France. Couldn’t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers ‘blubbing’ from Ed Miliband?</div></td></tr><tr>

In the event, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen beat Scott to the pole by 34 days, largely because his team used dogs to haul their gear the entire way rather than use slower ponies.

Most of the images are owned by the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. These negatives were retained by Ponting and were sold by his family to a private collector after his death in 1935. Some of the pictures show the herd of ponies the team used to haul the equipment-laden sledges on the 800 mile trek that would end with the deaths of Scott and his polar party . Another captures the team of husky dogs. The two types of animal proved to be Scott's downfall as he got rid of the dogs on the final leg of the trek, wrongly believing they wouldn't make the ascent of Beardmore Glacier . Official photographer Herbert Ponting brought the negatives back to England with him in preparation for Scott to use for lecture and fundraising tours around the world upon his return . They had been in the family of the collector ever since and were sold by Henry Aldridge and Son Auctioneers of Devizes, Wiltshire, to an unnamed buyer. Andrew Aldridge, from the auctioneers, said: 'The negatives offer an incredible snapshot into one of the most famous British Antarctic expeditions of the 20th century. 'They show the brutal nature of the environment these brave men went on to endure. 'The clarity of the images is truly remarkable and includes previously unseen elements including the polar party marching, pitching tents and them having lunch. 'The vast majority of Ponting's pictures are in the Scott Polar Research Unit. As far as we can tell most of these negatives haven't been published before.' Scott's Terra Nova expedition arrived at Cape Evans on Ross Island in January 1911. After seeing out the austral winter Scott's polar party of 16 men set off in the November 1911 to be the first people to reach the South Pole. Scott and his men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them. All five men perished on their return journey after enduring dreadful conditions . Most of the images are owned by the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. They include general shots of the harsh landscape and ice shelves that only a handful of men had visited until that point . Sold at auction: The negatives were retained by Ponting and were sold by his family to a private collector after his death in 1935. They have now been sold by an auctioneers to an unnamed buyer . The supporting party of 11 men returned as planned at various stages during the 800 mile trek, leaving Scott, Wilson, Oates, Evans and Bowers to reach the pole. The men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Amundsen had beaten them to it. On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite. Evans died on February 17, 1912 and a flagging Oates famously died on March 16 after walking out of the tent into a blizzard to give the remaining three a chance of survival. Scott, Wilson and Bowers died in the tent on or about March 29. Their bodies were found eight months later by a rescue party.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-11-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Judd Trump was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. Trump led 7-2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of Stuart Carrington but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10-6 victory. The 25-year-old closed with a century and will now face Marco Fu in the next round. Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 on Thursday in the first round of the World Championship . 'I'm just going to focus on my own game,' he told BBC Two. 'If I play how I know I can, I'll win it.' A re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract Carrington who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four. Trump took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from Carrington followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8-5 at the interval. Carrington got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and Trump swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory. Grimsby potter Carrington showed his mettle, though, with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from Trump put an end to his campaign. And the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent, who was making his Crucible debut. Trump (pictured) led 7-2 from Wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by Carrington . 'He played really well considering it's his first time here,' he said. 'Second session he hardly missed a ball. He probably won't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks. 'He played as good as anyone I've seen first time here.' Trump is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year. 'There's obviously a lot of anticipation this year,' he added. 'My results have shown that I'm playing some good stuff, I felt like I played well over the past two days. 'There's obviously a few things I need to work on but other than that I feel very confident. 'It was nice for Stuart to play as he did, it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you won't get many sessions where someone plays that well.' After being five frames behind, Carrington closed the gap to three before Trump earned the victory . At the press conference following his win, Trump was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long-time rival Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose 10-3 victory over Craig Steadman required a change of shoes. Having started Tuesday's match in a new pair of shoes, O'Sullivan discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director Mike Ganley's shoes which 'felt great' to him. Of the incident, Trump said: 'I didn't really see it but I heard about it. Obviously, he likes attention. I don't know if he's done it on purpose or not, who knows?' As to the overall favourite for the World Championship, Trump was quick to divert attention away from O'Sullivan, adding: 'In my eyes, I think Neil's (Robertson) probably the underdog, . Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley . 'I think Neil's favourite to win the tournament. Neil and Mark (Selby) are going to be the toughest two. Ronnie is obviously a good player but I'm confident of beating anyone.' On the other table, defending champion Mark Selby was locked in a tough battle with Anthony McGill in the opening second round match. Selby, who needed to scrap for a 10-9 win over Kurt Maflin in the first round, got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames. The first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for McGill before runs of 51 and 46 saw Selby on the board. The Leicester cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead. Defending champion Mark Selby closed the session at 4-4 with Anthony McGill in their second round match . McGill was not daunted, though, and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4-3 lead before Selby drew level again to end the session at 4-4. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion and current Masters title holder, conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7-2 as he wrapped up a 10-3 win over Robin Hull. Murphy's first frame on Thursday was a tight affair at 56-55 and he went on to win the next 64-33. Finland's Hull was able to pick up frame 12 but Murphy's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111. It sealed his passage to the second round where he will meet Joe Perry, who had beaten Zhang Anda 10-4. Shaun Murphy wrapped up victory against Finland's Robin Hull with a 10-3 win on Thursday . Ding Junhui has a chance of progressing past John Higgins after his break of 94 sealed frame eight to leave the Chinese 5-3 down going into Friday's session. Higgins had picked up back-to-back frames at the start without much fuss, including 81 on the first, though Ding's class showed in a 135 break in the third. Four-time World Championship winner Higgins then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce, starting with 116-6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5-1. However, Ding fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit, though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black, on what was to prove the last shot of the day.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Manchester City Under 18s boss Jason Wilcox, whose side take on Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final on Monday, is aiming to emulate United's famous Class of '92. Wilcox, himself let go by his current employers as a teenager, could field a starting XI of players all born in Greater Manchester for the clash against the favoured opponents from west London. And, while it may be unlikely anyone will emulate a golden generation across town that yielded the likes of the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, the ex-Blackburn winger believes that is the target. Manchester City Under 18s manager Jason Wilcox wants to deliver local players to the first team . Wilcox talks with Manchester City elite development squad coach Patrick Vieira . 'It could happen again but they were freak years,' Wilcox said. 'You look at United as a one-off, Barcelona the same. 'Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge.' The first leg will take place under lights at the impressive, newly-opened 7,200-capacity stadium within the grounds of the £200m Etihad Campus, a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within. Wilcox believes those facilities, coupled with elite coaching, stand City in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent. Wilcox hopes to emulate Manchester United's 'Class of 92' but says it will be very difficult . 'We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea,' he said. 'It's up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I'm convinced once they see us it's very difficult to walk away from.' Will the final, between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players, be a chance to stick two fingers up to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, who a year ago described the lack of English talent at Manchester City as 'pretty depressing'? Wilcox does not want to get into that. 'There’s a lot of media attention from Greg Dyke with regards to increasing the home-grown quota,' he said. Wilcox believes City's new Etihad campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters . A look inside one of the gyms at Manchester City's training complex . 'We can’t get embroiled in that because, for us, it’s a day-to-day question of how do we improve players? 'Proposals have already been put forward with regards to home-grown quotas. If he (Dyke) wants to increase it, then that is up to him. But whether you increase or lower the numbers, it doesn’t change the fact that you have to be good enough to get through.' Wilcox knows all about being good enough to get through at a club where money is no object. The Bolton youngster, who joined Blackburn at 14, was the only youth product to regularly appear in their Jack Walker-fuelled Premier League triumph in 1995. 'When I was a young player at Blackburn Jack Walker came in and brought Kenny (Dalglish),' he said. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . 'You go two ways. Do I go elsewhere and take my chances or have I got stomach for fight and see what happens? Luckily for me I was the only homegrown player which was a great privilege. Now I'm passing my experience to younger ones.' Wilcox's arrival at Ewood Park came after rejection at none other than City. He remembers it well. 'I’d joined City at 13 and got released at 14,' he recalled. 'It’s quite fitting really because when I’m speaking to younger players I can always recall that chat if you like. I think at that time it was a case of I just got told that they were not going to retain me on a year’s contract. 'It was devastating at the time. Everything was going really well. But to be told that it is tough for a young kid. But I just recall my own experience whenever I have to tell the lads and have the younger age groups. You have to go through some period in your life like that where not everything is going to go fantastically well.' Wilcox was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for Blackburn during title-winning season . City manager Manuel Pellegrini will be at the Etihad Campus, as will England Under 21s chief Gareth Southgate. Things have not gone according to plan for the Chilean's first team this season, but does Wilcox believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club's only silverware this season? 'Not really,' he said. 'At the start of the year, irrespective of what was happening at first-team level, the FA Youth Cup was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and I think it’s great that they are being put under a bit of pressure.' Aided by Wilcox's wise head, they appear to be thriving under it.</div></td></tr><tr>

But on the green, green grass of home, his side were the ones denting hopes of facing the Continent’s elite teams with this 2-1 victory over Ronald Koeman’s Southampton. The Stoke manager believes Jones’s hit Delilah, belted out regularly by the Britannia Stadium hordes, is causing his side to be marked down in UEFA’s Fair Play League because of its violent theme and thus affecting their chances of qualifying for the Europa League.

However, after Morgan Schneiderlin prodded Southampton into a deserved lead, a second-half turnaround with goals from Mame Diouf and Charlie Adam damaged the visitors hopes of finishing in the top four — and had the Stoke fans belting out their favourite 60s hit. Hughes said: ‘We are not going to get too many Fair Play points today. ‘The key was that we got three Premier League points, though.’ The result had Koeman acknowledging that the Saints’ unlikely march to the top four was over. ‘Sometimes I have to answer questions about Champions League football,’ he said. ‘I don’t like that because the distance to fourth place is five points and now maybe it is eight. We are fighting for a Europa League place — that’s our Champions League. You have to see it like that.’ Mame Biram Diouf is joined by teammate Jon Walters as the Stoke City duo celebrate their equaliser at the Britannia Stadium . Steven Nzonzi is quick to congratulate Diouf on his goal against Champions League chasing Southampton at the Britannia Stadium . French international Morgan Schneiderlin gives Ronald Koeman's Champions League chasing Southampton the lead at the Britannia Stadium . Hughes is entitled to be happy, with his side in ninth spot with five matches to play. Survival in the Premier League, always the priority in these parts, was secured as early as March, leaving the manager, with the ink drying on a four-year contract, to set new targets. He wants Stoke to better last year’s points tally of 50 and secure consecutive top-half finishes in the top flight for the first time in 40 years, and this result leaves such feats on the cards. Victory was unlikely in a one-sided first half. Southampton, who had wasted chances, eventually took one when Jose Fonte rose at the near post to divert Steven Davis’s corner goalwards but was denied by a goal-hanging Schneiderlin, who got the final touch before it crossed the line. Graziano Pelle should have doubled the lead when played in by a lively Sadio Mane but Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved well to leave Koeman ruing his side’s profligacy. ‘I think we played very well in the first 45 minutes and were by far better team,’ he said. ‘Maybe we could have been more clinical in the box but in general we played well today, we played at least at our level and it’s important to keep that for rest of the season.’ For all Southampton’s dominance Stoke should have been level when Geoff Cameron flicked on a Marko Arnautovic free-kick only for an unmarked Steven Nzonzi to inexplicably miss from no more than two yards out.

Schneiderlin  celebrates the first goal with his team-mates during the Barclays Premier League match between Stoke City and Southampton . They did go level following the arrival of Adam from the bench, albeit in exceptionally fortunate circumstances. When Nzonzi mis-hit a cross into the sky there were groans. When it landed on the bar and Diouf slammed home the rebound they turned into disbelieving cheers. The first Delilah of the day duly followed, with Adam urged to shoot wherever he picked up the ball. With six minutes remaining he did just that, lashing home following a goalmouth scramble to bring that song out again. ‘I think he played the initial ball into the box, followed his ball in and thankfully it has dropped to him,’ said an admiring Hughes. ‘It’s great technique. He knows exactly what he is doing. He has hit it into the ground and that has made it even harder for the keeper to save it.’ Adam’s fellow substitute Peter Crouch could have piled on the agony for Koeman after being teed up by Jonathan Walters but scuffed his shot wide from six yards. More misery for the Saints arrived in injury time when Toby Alderweireld went down clutching a shoulder and was carried off on a stretcher, although he is expected to be fit for the remainder of the run-in.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Most people give up chocolate for Lent but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own. Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 . The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square . The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery . 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter . Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion . The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not . 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown . Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine . Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: "exercise as an adult really sucks." It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber . The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings . 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising £10,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Nick Clegg will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. At the launch of their manifesto today, the Liberal Democrats will vow to protect the entire education budget in the next parliament ‘from cradle to college’. Unlike Tory and Labour plans, spending would rise per pupil – with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years – and also in line with inflation from 2018. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left) will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. His wife Miriam is pictured in Marple, Greater Manchester yesterday . It is understood that Mr Clegg will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7, in order to win over ‘centre-ground’ Conservative voters worried about funding cuts for schools. Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to £9,000 per year. But Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges. The tuition fees pledge was not on the front page in 2010, and the Lib Dem leader said those which were, such as increasing the income tax allowance, he had stuck ‘doggedly, religiously’ to. Protecting the education budget in real terms for children aged two to 19, will cost an additional £5billion a year more than the Conservatives plan to spend, and £2.5billion a year more than Labour. It would kick in from 2018-19, after the deficit has been cleared under Lib Dem plans and be funded by the proceeds of economic growth. Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges . In a pitch to Tory voters in battleground areas such as the South West, Mr Clegg will say people ‘are right to distrust the Conservatives on education’. ‘Our manifesto has one simple ambition and word at its heart, opportunity’, he said last night. ‘It’s the very old liberal idea that every should be able to live out their life to the full regardless of the circumstances of the circumstances of their birth, of the income of his or her parents or where they come from. ‘Education is the great liberator of people’s potential so we need to make sure we support the education system in the next Parliament. ‘The great challenge is we have more and more young people coming into our education system, so we need to make sure that the money is there to educate every single pupil even as their numbers increase. ‘We are determined to make sure that every child in Britain has a world class education.’ The money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom, training more teachers, more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education. Speaking on the campaign trail in Lewes in East Sussex, Mr Clegg said he had noticed voters in seats fought between the Tories and Lib Dems were expressing concern about spending on public services. The Tories have matched Lib Dem plans to offer £8billion a year in extra health spending to meet a request from the head of NHS England. By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The Green Party would abolish new road building and increase public spending by a fifth to pay for a vast wish-list of commitments, its manifesto revealed yesterday. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation. Launching the 84-page manifesto in trendy Dalston, East London, she said it amounted to a ‘peaceful political revolution’. Proposed policies include protections for the ‘nomadic lifestyle’, a promise to ‘ensure respect for everyone’, and adopting an approach of ‘defensive defence’ while abolishing the Trident nuclear deterrent. The age of criminal responsibility would be raised from ten to 14, cannabis and other drugs legalised, and there would be an amnesty for illegal immigrants here for three years or more. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation . But questions were raised over whether the hikes in taxes on the richest would raise anything like the billions promised. Even manifesto author Brian Heatley admitted the plans were based on ‘a lot of estimation and judgment’. The proposals would see public spending go up by £177billion a year by the end of the Parliament. A new tax would charge anyone with £3million 2 per cent of their wealth, and top earners would pay 60p in the pound. Corporation tax would go up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished. The party promises to scrap the £15billion major roads spending programme, bring in a ‘Citizen’s Pension’ of £180 a week for single OAPs and £310 for a couple, and hugely increase spending on health, social care and social housing. Foreign aid spending would rise by another £6billion a year, child benefit would double, tuition fees would be abolished and pupils would get organic school dinners. Other policies include a promise to end the use of nuclear and coal power stations and ban fracking. Railways would be renationalised, there would be a ban on fur imports, and cages for rabbits and hens in farming would be outlawed.</div></td></tr><tr>

In a nightmare for Labour, which is battling to fend off an SNP landslide in its traditional Scottish heartlands, Miss Sturgeon was deemed well ahead – with Mr Miliband trailing David Cameron and Nigel Farage. Overall, an average of four polls of viewers put Mr Cameron just ahead – and to the Tories’ delight, he also emerged with a clear lead on who is seen ‘most capable of leading the country’. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon was hailed as the shock winner of the TV debate by one poll, inflicting a damaging blow to Ed Miliband's election hopes . ComRes put him on 40 per cent as the best prime minister, with Mr Miliband on 28 per cent and Mr Farage just 10 per cent. Last night a national voting intention poll by YouGov put the Conservatives ahead of their vote share at the last election, and at their highest point since 2013, with 37 per cent to Labour’s 35 per cent. But it was Miss Sturgeon’s success among viewers across the UK that was the biggest surprise of the night. Peeping out: The Tory poster depicting Ed Miliband in Nicola Sturgeon's pocket . The Tories rushed out a poster depicting Ed Miliband in Nicola Sturgeon’s pocket last night – saying the SNP leader had ‘dominated’ him in the debate. A hapless-looking Labour leader was seen peering out of the top pocket of a contented Miss Sturgeon, who triumphed in one of the main post-debate polls. If Labour fails to win a majority in the election, it is expected that Mr Miliband may have to come to a deal with the Scottish Nationalists if he is to get into Number 10. A tweet from Conservative campaign headquarters said: ‘Nicola Sturgeon dominated Miliband – an interesting glimpse into what life would be like under a Miliband/SNP deal’. The poster follows a similar one released last month showing Mr Miliband in the pocket of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who has declared that he will help write the Labour budget. It revives memories of the 1980s Spitting Image depiction of the then Liberal leader David Steel in the pocket of David Owen, leader of the SDP. The two parties were in alliance at the time. Scotland’s steely First Minister left the Labour leader squirming as she attacked him from the Left on tax and spending. In the key moments in last night’s two hour, seven-way clash: . Miss Sturgeon, a veteran of TV debates in the Scottish referendum campaign, repeatedly left the Labour leader discomforted – and forced him to suggest that Labour is not now committed to plans to find another £30billion through tax rises and spending cuts, which he voted for earlier this year. But Miss Sturgeon also gave Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg a rough ride, saying it was time to ‘break the old boys’ network at Westminster’. In an early intervention, she mocked the Coalition leaders for arguing about their future spending plans, saying: ‘It is really interesting watching David Cameron and Nick Clegg attack each other, when they have been working hand in glove for the past five years.’ But Miss Sturgeon saved her main fire for Mr Miliband, scolding him for paying lip service to the need for further cuts. ‘Ed talks the language on austerity, but it’s only a few weeks since he trooped through the lobbies to vote for £30billion of cuts,’ she said. Challenging the Labour leader directly, she said: ‘We need to invest and grow our way out of austerity – why did you vote for £30billion of cuts?’ As Mr Cameron looked on smiling, Mr Miliband responded weakly: ‘That wasn’t what the vote was for.’ Mr Clegg ambushed the Prime Minister at the first opportunity after five years of Coalition, saying: ‘I believe you need to make the necessary cuts because you have to. 'George Osborne and David Cameron do it because they want to.’ Mr Cameron retorted: ‘I defend all our decisions – you have a pick-and-mix approach.’ Miss Sturgeon forced Milband to suggest that Labour is not now committed to plans to find another £30billion through tax rises and spending cuts, which he voted for earlier this year . The seven leaders in the TV debate: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative) Cameron heckler is thrown out . A female heckler was removed from the debate audience after she interrupted the Prime Minister. Victoria Prosser, 33, said that she wanted to challenge the ‘1 per cent at the top’. As David Cameron tried to answer a question, the self-described ‘wellbeing guru’, who was dressed in a sheepskin-style gilet, stood up and heckled. She called out: ‘There’s homeless people on the streets that have been in the services.’ Debate moderator Julie Etchingham tried to stop the woman, telling her: ‘Not from the audience thank you.’ 'I'm sorry': As David Cameron tried to answer a question Victoria Prosser, 33, stood up and heckled him about homeless people who had served in the armed forces . But she continued: ‘I have to speak out because I’m worried. At the end of the day there’s more of us than them and they’re not listening to us.’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘The lady makes an important point that there are people who come out of our armed services who have difficulties and that’s why we should be putting money into armed forces charities that help homeless people.’ During his response, she could be heard shouting: ‘It’s not the truth.’ She was then forcibly removed from the TV studio. On her Twitter account she describes herself as ‘mum, coach, artist, wellbeing guru!’ She has previously re-tweeted negative posts about Ukip and Mr Cameron. According to her internet profiles, she volunteers at a homeless project in Manchester as well as working at a vegetarian cafe in Salford. Outside the studio, Miss Prosser said she had been ‘emotionally moved by David Cameron using vulnerable people’. She added: ‘I can’t vote for anyone who I know is lying or omitting facts. That means I couldn’t vote for any of the people that I saw tonight.’ Ed Miliband sent an aide to Manchester to pick up two pairs of shoes for last night’s debate. The Labour leader’s assistant was despatched to Clark’s on Market Street in Manchester to pick up two pairs of classic black shoes. She bought the Francis Air and Glenrise Walk brands, each priced at £65. The revelation that Mr Miliband bought two pairs of shoes for one debate will add to claims he is indecisive, and comes just weeks after it emerged his house has two kitchens. Clark’s assistant Laura Roberts, 22, said: ‘I helped his aide pick the two choices. They are two of our best-sellers. I’ll be watching to see which one he chooses.’</div></td></tr><tr>

The Prime Minister's wife swooped into Rochester and Strood, the seat held by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last summer. David Cameron has made no secret of his desire to kick Mr Reckless's 'fat arse' out of the Commons, and clearly hopes his wife can woo voters in the crucial Kent battleground. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold . Mrs Cameron joined Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Mrs Cameron met Mitchell, aged four, at the Abbey Court School in Rainham, a special school  for three to 19-year-olds . She also spoke to five-year-old Jessica at the school, which aides said was 'very close to her heart' Mrs Cameron's first solo appearance three days into the campaign will be seen as a statement of intent from the Conservatives, who are desperate to wrest the seat back from Ukip following the by-election. Visiting a special school in the constituency, she joked that she was pleased that her campaigning duties did not stretch to a live TV debate. Mr Cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.' When Mr Reckless defected from the Tories last year, the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary attack on his betrayal. Mr Cameron argued that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. But after the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the by-election triggered by his decision to join Ukip, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920. Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Miss Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate' Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister . Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Tory Kelly Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate'. Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.' Miss Tolhurst who stood against Mr Reckless at the Rochester and Strood by-election in November. She greeted Mrs Cameron as she arrived for the visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Mrs Cameron wore a Cos raspberry coloured blouse and a blue skirt from Toast, teamed with navy shoes from Zara. She met head teacher Karen Joy as she toured the site for three to 19-year-olds with special educational needs, which aides said was 'very close to her heart'. Mark Reckless defected from the Tories to Ukip last summer. After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920 . In September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit. Senior Conservatives reacted with fury.  Party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the Tory conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless, declaring: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ Mr Cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things. 'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.' In November's by-election, Mr Reckless won 42 per cent of the vote, ahead of Kelly Tolhurst on 35 per cent . Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne today visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . The Tory power couple were filmed together at the weekend during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. Speaking to a patient, they discussed their many hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.'</div></td></tr><tr>

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The  name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch .

Michael Bialek also described as a 'complex character as many young people are today' but added she was a loving mother, daughter and wife and he simply wanted her home.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Worried: Alice Dreger attended the class at East Lansing High School after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand . An outraged mom live tweeted her son's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance. Author Alice Dreger took to Twitter to express her horror at what she heard at East Lansing High School, in Michigan, when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week. Ms Dreger, a respected professor, began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex. According to the 45 tweets sent by Ms Dreger during the lesson, stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant, people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts. 'The whole lesson here is "sex is part of a terrible lifestyle. Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster",' tweeted Ms Dreger. She added: 'I feel like raising my hand and saying "Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?"' Ms Dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students, who are freshmen in high school, by the teacher, who did not normally work at the school. At one point, paper babies were handed around the class to show how 'easily' condoms fail: the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times. "We are going to roll this dice eight times,' Ms Dreger reported the teacher as saying. 'Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby.' In fact, according to the NHS, just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly. Outrage: Ms Dreger's tweets, above, show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . Untrue: The school has denied it only teaches abstinence, saying it just happened to be that day's lesson . The tweets went viral, with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education. But the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day's lecture which focused on the subject. 'Abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe, but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices. This parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught,' high school principal Coby Fletcher said in the statement released to The Lansing State Journal. The school has taken no direct action against Ms Dreger for the tweets. They have, however, banned her from the premises - apart from her son's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson. @alicedreger: The kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is, so I'm going. But hands over my mouth means I can't live-tweet it . @alicedreger: Uh oh. They stuck me in the corner with my computer and there is wifi....so I can live tweet this. We still pledge loyalty to the flag, huh? @alicedreger: I can't stand this. They're teaching "abstinence stories" that worked and non-abstinence" stories that "led to consequences." @alicedreger: The visitor-teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex. My kid is trying to show her studies that dispute that. @alicedreger: She's being completely condescending. "You can look up anything on the internet" Then refers him to site on abstinence education! @alicedreger: I feel like raising my hand and saying "Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?" @alicedreger: And how I've had a lot of lovers and have never gotten pregnant by accident? Yes, I had HPV! And I would get the vaccine! @alicedreger: In fact I have had the vaccine! @alicedreger: Now we're hearing a horror story about marijuana use. @alicedreger: The regular health teacher in trying to shut my kid up referred to "LGBYT." And how the board decides what we learn. @alicedreger: The guy telling the "abstinence" story is now telling us about having sex as a teenager. I'm confused. @alicedreger: Now he's talking about getting a girl preg and them hiding it from their parents. Yup, that's what sexual shame does, dude! @alicedreger: Preg girl got picked on so her friends desserted her. That's what happens if you have sex, kids! Yup! Pregnant and NO FRIENDS! @alicedreger: He and the girl both had alcoholic fathers. But somehow he's not recommending never drinking. @alicedreger: The whole lesson here is "sex is part of a terrible lifestyle. Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster" @alicedreger: This guy really thinks this story of "I f***** up for years and years" is going to lead to other kids not f**** up. @alicedreger: Whereas the lesson I would take is "sometimes it takes years to get your s*** together, and that's okay"? @alicedreger: Oh and of course, now a story about a friend who OD'ed and "was a vegetable 11 years. Tore their family apart." FFS. Welcome to sex ed. @alicedreger: This whole story of OD's, people in prison, out-of-marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy's resilience and normalcy. @alicedreger: "I have a daughter whose 21 and I would go absolutely nuts if I knew she ever let a stranger into her house." @alicedreger: "I finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence, and her life was so much better. I put her on a pedestal above everyone else." @alicedreger: "I liked her so much [I so wanted to **** her] I decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence [until I could F*** her]." @alicedreger: "Two years after we started dating I asked her to marry me and we're 8 years married." And I'll bet yer f****, aren't ya! @alicedreger: "We're not saying having sex is a bad thing. My story I can say having sex was a bad thing for me because I craved it." @alicedreger: "You'll find a good girl. If you find one that says 'no,' that's the one you want." HE ACTUALLY JUST SAID THAT. @alicedreger: "We can look up things on the internet but until you live that lifestyle you won't see it the same." The whole talk is "lifestyle." @alicedreger: Now the woman is up. "Sometimes condoms fail." @alicedreger: She says "it is absolutely better to use something than nothing" in terms of birth control. "But it can fail." @alicedreger: "It takes only 1 sperm to fertilize an egg. It takes only 1 time having sex to get pregnant." Yet she's not suggesting oral or a***. @alicedreger: She's now telling story of condom box in which EVERY SINGLE CONDOM HAD A HOLE. @alicedreger: She says per the FDA 1 out of every 400 boxes of condom can be totally defective. "You might get that 400th box." BE AFRAID! @alicedreger: About 18% chance a condom will fail, she says. @alicedreger: "On average 1 out of 6 times there is a mishap with a condom." "Every day in US 1600+ teen pregnancies." Lesson: condoms fail? WTF? @alicedreger: Condoms. They fail. You get pregnant. Your friends leave you. You drop out of school. Your kids end up in the army. @alicedreger: "We are going to roll this dice 8 times. Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby." J****!!! @alicedreger: Paper babies are being handed out to EVERYONE. They have ALL HAD CONDOM FAILURE AND THE WHOLE CLASS IS PREGNANT. @alicedreger: "You have to have a baby!" There are apparently no scissors in the room for paper abortions. @alicedreger: "I'm going to collect the babies that you don't want. We recycle them." @alicedreger: "Safe sex is kind of a misnomer." @alicedreger: It's over. I need a drink. @alicedreger: I can't get up. I'm too stunned.</div></td></tr></tbody>
