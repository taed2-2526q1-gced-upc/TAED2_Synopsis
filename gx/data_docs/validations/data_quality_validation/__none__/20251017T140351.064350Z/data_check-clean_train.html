imprisonment in Portlaoise prison in the Irish Republic in 1974...I was .
named in some British newspapers as being responsible for the Hyde Park .

have strongly supported the peace process from the very beginning of the .

contact the UK government to check it would be OK as I didn't want any .
problems. They said that would be fine.’ He is subsequently charged over .
the murder of four British soldiers and causing an explosion.
January 2014 .

Tony Blair faces being called to Parliament over a secret deal with Sinn Fein which allowed suspected IRA bombers to avoid prosecution. The former Prime Minister is set to be summoned by the Northern Ireland select committee to explain the controversial 'comfort letters' sent to on-the-run suspects telling them they were not being sought by the police. MPs are warning that if he fails to appear there will be 'bad publicity'. The policy led to the collapse of the trial of suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing in March. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Mr Blair's Labour government saw around 200 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. The letters did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence emerged. The Northern Ireland committee is investigating the deal after the collapse of the case against Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing which killed four soldiers. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. The committee has taken evidence from senior police officers in Northern Ireland, and Labour politicians who served as Northern Ireland Secretary in the Labour government. Mr Blair is understood to have provided written evidence to the committee, but could be called to appear in person to answer questions direct from MPs. IRA suspect John Downey walked free from court in March after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed . Committee chairman Laurence Robertson told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Mr Blair has not found a date in his diary. ‘We are going to have to press him. Technically we can compel him to attend. ‘I don’t want to have to get to that point yet but others on the committee will want to do that. ‘There is going to be bad publicity … if he doesn’t come because people will draw their own conclusion. ‘I take the view Mr Blair has a duty to come and explain it. He is right at the thick of it.’ Mr Blair’s office has previously suggested the sticking point has been finding a suitable date to fit in with his role as a Middle East peace envoy and when the committee is sitting. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Tony Blair has already given evidence in person to the Hallett Review and has said he is happy to also give evidence to the Committee, we are in discussions about the best way to do that given the current demands of his Middle East role.' The spokesman said they did not know anything suggestions Mr Blair could appear via video link. On Thursday the results of another inquiry into the affair, led by Lady Justice Heather Hallett, will be published. Lady Justice Hallett's report is expected to address secret negotiations between Mr Blair and Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, on how to deal with "on-the-run" suspects. Because they had not been convicted, they did not fall within the scope of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which saw jailed paramilitaries released early.

The use of an incorrect date of birth to search a police database may have missed an offence potentially linked to an individual. An individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist offence. It has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance.
An individual who was wanted for an offence committed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted. The origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police believed they were only searching for pre-1998 offences and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 offence when informing the Northern Ireland Office that the individual was 'not wanted by the PSNI'.

A review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made. Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way so-called ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run. Critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA's Hyde Park bombing in 1982. David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Tony Blair's Labour government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. Lady Justice Hallett said the scheme was not well publicised, and effectively kept 'below the radar', but was not secret. 'The administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty,' she said. 'Suspected terrorists were not handed a 'get out of jail free card'.' But shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made. They included: . The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters. Democratic Unionist First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when Mr Cameron ordered the review. A police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked, though only by intelligence, to 295 murders during the Troubles. Today Mr Robinson said the scheme was ‘wrong in principle and shambolic in practice’. He added: ‘Of course it was a get out of jail free card for Downey. 'It has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that Lady Justice Hallett refers to as in error, it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out. ‘And indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge.’ Northern Ireland's most senior police officer said it was 'highly unlikely' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases. Chief constable George Hamilton said he accepted Lady Justice Hallett's findings and apologised to the Hyde Park victims. He said: 'The difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place.' He added: 'If they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application (to collapse the case) would be successful as it was in the Downey case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it.' Under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein, before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status. A report on each individual was sent back to the Government and, if they were declared as not being wanted, a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals. In the Commons today, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'I know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity (Hyde Park) and I apologise again on behalf of this Government for any hurt that has caused.' She added: 'I fully accept the Hallett Report's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the Government will act on them. 'But, as I have said before, as far as this Government is concerned, the OTR scheme is over.'

Office furniture maker Steelcase surveyed more than 2,000 people in countries to identify nine new postures .
The Draw – Technology (small and mobile) allows people to pull back from their desks while they use it. They recline, signaling they’re contemplating or absorbing information and draw the device closer to their body to maintain an optimal focal length.
The Multi-Device - This posture is representative of how people adapt to multitasking on multiple-devices. One hand holding a phone to the ear, the other tasking on a laptop. The result is a forward lean that is a symbol of concentration and an orientation to the smaller screen of a laptop.
The Text - Smartphones are small compared to other forms of technology and, therefore, require unique postures. Workers bring arms in close as keying and gesturing are performed.
The Cocoon - People recline, bring up their feet onto the seat, and draw their smartphone or tablet close, resting on their thighs. The result is a cocoon - small mobile technology allows people to remain productive in this posture.
The Swipe - This posture results when the device is used on a work surface in 'surfing mode', in which people operate the device with one hand, typically with swiping gestures. Because it’s on a work surface, a person must keep their head a certain distance above the tablet in order to see it, and position their head to look down at it.
The Smart Lean - This posture is the result of mobile devices that create the desire for people to temporarily 'pull away' from others without leaving a meeting or collaborative environment. This is typically a temporary posture and used for glancing at incoming texts or e-mails.
The Trance - This posture was observed when people were focused on the screen and either mousing or using a touchpad to navigate on the screen for extended periods of time. This is a long duration posture.
The Take It In - In this posture, people recline to view content on the large display and/or sit back to contemplate. This posture is about 'taking in' information rather than generating it.
The Strunch .
- The 'strunch' (stretched-out hunch) is a very common posture with .
laptops. As people become fatigued, they gradually push their laptop .
further from the edge of the worksurface, resting their weight on the .
surface.  This causes them to reach forward to work. Since the back and .
neck cannot sustain the reach and hunch posture for a long time, the .
person begins to prop themselves up with their non- tasking arm.</span><span>By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:45 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 26 February 2013 . Laptops, tablets and smartphones have dramatically changed the way we work - and even the way we sit, researchers have claimed. A new study has found that most desks, designed for traditional 'desktop' computers, have meant we have created a range of new ways to sit. They range from 'the cocoon', where people hunch up on their chair to be close to their phone, to 'the smart lean', used to  check emails during a meeting. The nine new workplace postures: These new ways of sitting and slouching to fit ourselves around new mobile computing technology have been identified by research from office furniture company Steelcase . Smartphones and tablet computers, small and light enough to be grasped in the hands, have liberated workers from postural slavery to our digital overseers. Now new research has shown that the change in the ways we deal with technology in the workplace is indeed changing the way that we sit and slouch while we're earning our keep. A survey of 2,000 office workers in 11 countries undertaken by office furniture maker Steelcase has identified nine new postures which have emerged in response to the new technologies we interact with. They are: . Contorting to fit: Office workers have hitherto been kept in postural bondage to the immobile machines they interact with to earn their keep . The new postures identified were a result of using small, mobile technology such as smartphones, tablets and laptops and new workplace behaviours. However, with furniture poorly adapted to these new ways of sitting and slouching, Steelcase notes, they frequently cause pain and long-term injuries, disrupting concentration and creativity. James Ludwig, vice president of global design for Steelcase, said: 'We love our technology – it’s become a ubiquitous extension of ourselves. 'But the way technology impacts our bodies as we work has been largely ignored.' Based on this research, Steelcase has designed a new chair – Gesture – that moves with the body and supports the user throughout the different postures.  It will be available in the UK later this year.</span></div></td></tr><tr>

The winner of the last 11 European Super Cups has alternated between the reigning Champions League winners and the reigning UEFA Cup/Europa League winners. With Bayern Munich winning last season, Sevilla must win the 2014 edition for this trend to continue.
Real Madrid are the only team to lose a European Super Cup to a golden goal; they were beaten 2-1 by Galatasaray in 2000.
The last UEFA Super Cup to feature two teams from the same country also featured Sevilla; they beat Barcelona 3-0 in the 2006 edition.
Sevilla were also the last Spanish side to lose this game; they were beaten 3-1 by Milan in 2007. The last four Spanish sides to qualify for this competition have won.
Real Madrid have won only one of their three previous European Super Cups. They were beaten in 1998 and 2000 before beating Feyenoord 3-1 in 2002. Iker Casillas started the 2000 and 2002 games.
The last 13 La Liga meetings between Real Madrid and Sevilla have seen 64 goals scored; an average of just under five per game.
The Whites have won nine of their last 11 meetings with the Andalusian side in all competitions, but have lost the last two away from the Bernabeu (both away league games).
The one previous clash in a major European competition came in the 1958 European Cup quarter-final. Los Merengues won 8-0 at home before drawing 2-2 away to progress.
Welshman Gareth Bale scored two goals and assisted two more in two league appearances against Sevilla last season.
Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 16 goals in nine La Liga games against Sevilla; he has scored more goals against them than any other side in the competition.
James Rodriguez could make his first competitive appearance for Real Madrid in this game. He scored six goals in five World Cup 2014 appearances, collecting the Golden Boot in the process.

Precision Engineering of Genomes: The revision and deletion of DNA in higher organisms has generally been hit-or-miss.

Scientists had been chasing the Higgs boson, nicknamed the 'God particle' for more than four decades. In July the team from the European nuclear research facility at Cern in Geneva announced the detection of a particle that fitted the description of the elusive Higgs. Top breakthrough: A representation of traces of traces of a proton-proton collision measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experience in the search for the Higgs boson . The boson is believed to give matter mass via an associated 'Higgs field' that permeates space. Without the property of mass, the universe we live in could not exist. Scientists used the world's biggest atom smashing machine, the £2.6billion Large Hadron Collider on the Swiss-French border, to track down the missing particle. Finding the Higgs topped the list of most important discoveries of 2012 released today by Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals. The particle was first proposed by a British physicist Professor Peter Higgs almost 50 years ago when he was a 34-year-old scientist working at the University of Edinburgh.

75% of men always have orgasms during sex, but only 30% of women do .
Taking turns is more practical, says leading sex expert Tracey Cox .
'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator'
Get him to have an orgasm first and make the 'together' orgasm the second one. Most men find they have much better control second time around.
Ignore the old advice of getting him to think about big pants or count backwards. The aim is distraction but it simply doesn't work. New research shows even as he's manically saying '459, 458' in his brain, another part is saying 'What does he think I am, stupid? As if this is going to grab my attention when I've got a pair of breasts bobbling in front of me, my penis is nestled in a nice, warm, sexy place, my girlfriend's moaning and throwing her head back and….'
Use the bridge manoeuvre: This is the technique most sex therapists recommend. The basic idea is to give you clitoral stimulation up to the point of, but not actually to, orgasm and let his thrusting trigger off the orgastic reflex. This effectively provides a 'bridge' between clitoral stimulation and intercourse.
Choose the right position. Woman on top or him from behind are the most likely positions to stimulate the front vaginal wall and up your chances of a penetrative orgasm.
Talk lots, telling each other exactly where you're at by using a number system. Groaning out a 'Nine!' or delivering a curt 'Still two' might seem odd to start, but it's a quick and effective way to communicate in bed.
Switch stimulation regularly. Not only will it keep you both hovering rather than climbing steadily toward a climax, it stops sex becoming too orgasm focused. Change positions. Change rooms. Change the CD. Anything to change the mood, keeping it hot and sexy but maintaining a measure of control.
Make friends with her vibrator. If you asked me the best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm, this would be it. One of you holding a wand vibrator (slim, cylindrical, non-intrusive) over the clitoral area during penetrative sex is the most effective way to ensure a shared orgasm experience.</span><span>By . Tracey Cox . Are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time? The myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' in unison, it's going to hang on there for some time yet. The reality is, you'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together. Let's take a look at the facts. Roughly 75% of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to 30% of women. Men's orgasms last around 5-10 seconds (if he's lucky), women's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more (much more, if she's lucky and he's adept). Do the math and you'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely. Romantic, yes. Likely, no. Quite frankly, taking turns - you have your orgasm first, he has his later - is not only more practical, it's sometimes a lot more satisfying. Having an orgasm is a selfish experience: you're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure. Having to pay attention to your partner's bits to guarantee they're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment doesn't enhance the experience, it interferes with it . For men, this is less of a problem. Their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered, continue. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through. While he's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy, we're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment. Yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through .

Spain and Holland have a perfectly even head-to-head record with four wins apiece and one draw, though Spain won the only previous World Cup clash 1-0 in the 2010 final.
The defending champions have only won their first game in three of the last 10 World Cups (D4 L3), with Italy drawing 1-1 with Paraguay last time out.

Vicente Del Bosque (Spain)Louis van Gaal (Holland)Team news: Spain and Holland played out one of the most disappointing World Cup finals in history four years ago. They get a chance to make amends right away in Brazil. In one of the quirks of the draw for Brazil, Spain opens the defense of its title against the country it beat in the championship decider in Johannesburg four years ago. But while Vicente Del Bosque's team has stuck to its attacking philosophy, Holland coach Louis van Gaal is packing his defense and hoping one of his three star forwards, Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben or Wesley Sneijder, can snatch a goal on the counterattack in their Group B opener at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador. Key clash: Wesley Sneijder vs Sergio Busquets . Four years ago Sneijder’s performances placed him in FIFA’s All-Star team but he was stopped by Busquets.

Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton had chased story for weeks .
Mackay pulled out of running to be new Crystal Palace boss .
Moody resigned from post at Selhursrt Park following revelations .
On Friday, Mackay publically apologised for the abusive texts .
After weeks of chasing the story, Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton discovers Cardiff have sent a dossier to the FA, claiming former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and Crystal Palace Sporting Director Iain Moody had exchanged ‘racist, sexist and homophobic’ texts and email messages. With the final piece of his investigation falling into place, Lawton contacts all parties for comments.
Sky Sports News reports that Mackay, who was expected to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager, has pulled out of the running to replace Tony Pulis.
Moody’s lawyers attempt unsuccessfully to stop the Daily Mail from publishing the allegations.
The Daily Mail publishes the exclusive story. Shortly after, former Cardiff City midfielder Ibrahim Farah takes to Twitter to label Mackay ‘disgusting’ and to complain about his treatment at the hands of Mackay.
Moody resigns from his role at Crystal Palace.
Leading football figures and anti-bigotry campaigners welcome the story, and call for swift action if allegations are substantiated.
Early in the evening, Mackay’s agent speaks to Sky Sports News, saying the former Cardiff manager is shocked by the allegations and will fight them.
Later in the evening, the League Managers Association issues an apology on Mackay’s behalf. Mackay denies allegations he is a racist and claims only ‘two’ of the text messages in question were sent by him. The ill-judged statement tries to dismiss the sordid exchanges between the two men as ‘friendly text banter’.
Twitter responds by pouring scorn on the statement, with prominent former footballers Jason Roberts and Stan Collymore leading the criticism.
Sportsmail publishes further details, with Lawton pointing out that, contrary to Mackay’s claims, the former Cardiff manager was reponsible for both racist and homophobic texts.
Rio Ferdinand publicly criticises the LMA as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘insensitive’.
The LMA apologises for its previous statement, conceding that ‘some of its wording’ was ‘inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature’.
Cardiff officials question Mackay’s assertion that he was only responsible for two offensive texts and express horror at the LMA’s choice of words. Cardiff also call for the LMA’s chief executive Richard Bevan to resign.
Sportsmail publishes further Textgate revelations from Lawton, with Mackay accused of calling the Cardiff owner Vincent Tan a ‘chink’.</span><span>Sportmsmail's Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton broke the story of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody's text exchange.

Hunt is now on to find someone worthy of filling the enormous hole he is leaving behind .
Early favorite is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for Stewart in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO .
List of potential replacements also includes Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and even disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams .
John Oliver: He's top of the list for a reason: He proved he could emerge from the Daily Show ranks and succeed as host when Stewart took a movie-making break. Oliver and his dimples defected to HBO, but his return home would be triumphant.
Tina Fey or Amy Poehler: Paired for efficiency's sake given their frequent collaborations. Like Stewart and Oliver, they've got the likability that helps make hard-hitting satire palatable — and how about at least one woman in late-night TV?
Amy Schumer: There is a growing argument that late-night television is long overdue a female host. The vacancy at The Daily Show could be an ideal opportunity for Schumer, whose Comedy Central series premiere in 2013 was the network’s most-watched premiere that year.
Chris Hardwick: A growing star at Comedy Central where he already hosts the social media-oriented show @midnight. The comedian also has a regular gig fronting Walking Dead spin-off The Talking Dead. Could be a strong contender because of his youthful fan base.
Chris Rock: Brilliantly funny, certainly fearless. He wrote an essay about being black in an entertainment industry that is 'kind of racist' in its hiring practices — although he said he wasn't being political at all, adding, 'that's Stewart, that's (Bill) Maher.'
Seth MacFarlane: He's a writer, performer and singer who can summon the juvenile glee, if not the artfulness, that Stewart employs to leaven the angst. And he could bring a sidekick, his devilish movie creation Ted the teddy bear.
Aisha Tyler: An experienced all-rounder with talent to spare. She co-hosts The Talk, has acted in series including Ghost Whisperer, CSI, Talk Soup and Friends and also hosts Whose Line is it Anyway?
Jessica Williams: A Daily Show player whose titles include 'senior youth' and 'senior Beyonce' correspondent, she's brimming with energy and edgy charm. Whether she has the experience and heft to step into the center ring is an open question.
Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones: Experienced Daily Show regulars but when Stewart took a break during the Summer of 2013 to direct his movie Rosewater, it was their colleague Oliver who was trusted in the big chair.
Joel McHale: The Soup host already balances his Community sitcom role with a host gig, so why not step it up? He's quick witted, lovable and has a following that encompasses the frat-boy demo that is undeniably part of the Daily Show fan base.
Brian Williams: The disgraced NBC Nightly News host has technically been sacked but is starting a six month suspension. Williams may use his extended break to reconsider where his career is going and isn't it his desire to be considered more than just a news anchor that got him into trouble in the first place? Could be just the reinvention he needs.</span><span>No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years at Comedy Central than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him. 'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you,' he told his audience on Tuesday night. He said he might depart in July, September or maybe December. Stewart's passion, wit and boldness make for a magical combination that will be difficult to re-create when he steps away later this year. Scroll down for video . No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him . Big shoes to fill: Late-night television is long overdue a female host and Amy Schumer could be the ideal candidate, while hosting The Daily Show could be just the reinvention Brian Williams needs . An early favorite to replace Stewart is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for him in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO . 'The X-factor here is Stewart's charisma. It's significant,' said Sophia McClennen, a Penn State professor and author of Is Satire Saving Our Nation?: Mockery And American Politics. The Daily Show averages just slightly more than 1 million viewers a night - a far smaller audience than his late-night competition on the big networks - but during his time as host Stewart has became disproportionately influential in U.S. politics and culture. Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012. It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004. In a 2004 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 21 percent of respondents aged 18 to 29 cited The Daily Show as a regular source of political news. The Daily Show boot camp has graduated a number of impressive talents who might prove to be worthy of the host chair, McClennen said, counting John Oliver first among a group including Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones. There are outsiders who certainly have the comedic chops. But do they have the star power and the backbone to speak punchlines to power, and on a nightly basis? Possible successors: Jessica Williams is already The Daily Show's 'senior youth' correspondent, while Chris Rock is an established comedian known for his outspoken views on modern America . Daily Show regulars Samantha Bee and Jason Jones are other names that have been thrown in the hat as the search begins to replace Jon Stewart . Looking over the possibilities, here are some candidates to consider: . Ex-SNL alumnae Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been mentioned as possible replacements for Jon Stewart . Other names in the frame for The Daily Show include Aisha Tyler and Joel McHale .</span></div></td></tr><tr>

The TV show ‘Great British Bake Off’ has captured the imagination of the nation and highlighted the joys of baking .</span><span>By . Toni Jones . PUBLISHED: . 09:29 EST, 16 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:26 EST, 16 October 2012 . Tonight's grand final of the Great British Bake Off is expected to draw over four million viewers. Not bad for a genteel BBC2 show about cakes. The show has become one of BBC2’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc and judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry whip up a TV storm. The show has been credited with making baking cool again, and reminding boys where the kitchen is (tonight's final is all male and judge Paul Hollywood's heartthrob status continues to soar). But Brtiain's love of baking isn't really new at all - just ask your grandmother. The trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century . From the launch of Good Housekeeping magazine in the 1920s to the introduction of TV chefs post-Coronation in the 1950s, the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends. Today's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking, and in the 1980s celebrity chef Delia Smith stirred our passions for the kitchen with her 'How to Cook' book. Factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s, rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s. To celebrate National Baking Week (which runs from 15th-21st October) and the Great British Bake Off final kitchen appliance company Kenwood has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from Wendy Wilson, archivist from Britain's oldest weekly women's magazine The Lady, and Dr Valerie Mars, a food historian. Dr Mars says: 'Baking trends are essentially uneven. Some people will always bake, especially in places with a long-standing tradition such as Yorkshire, but fashion also has a huge influence. In the current economic climate, an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times.' Bake Off judge and trained baker Paul Hollywood seen today ahead of the final . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Good Housekeeping magazine in 1932 focused on 'meals for the business girl' The popularity of new domestic appliances in the 1950s led to a rise in the trend for home baking . In the seventies the rise of the middle class meant that dinner parties became popular . Delia Smith, celebrity chef and Norwich fan lured us back in to the kitchen in the nineties with her back to basics approach . 4 million viewers are expected to watch finalists John Waite, James Morton and Brendan Lynch battle it out for the Great British Bake Off crown tonight in front of judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc .</span></div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>The Passat has been around for 42 years, the first model came out in 1973 .
The estate car is the fourth biggest-selling VW in the UK .
The new model has everything from keyless entry to heated seats .
Only diesel models will be on sale initially and there will be a beefed-up 4x4 version hitting the road in July .
It's hard to believe, but the Passat has been around for 42 years. More than 22 million have been made since 1973. So this is the eighth generation. It's a proven and indefatigable workhorse — the fact that the estate version comfortably outsells the svelte saloon testifies to that.
Brits bought 10,000 estates in 2013, against 7,600 saloons. The Passat is the fourth biggest-selling VW here after the Golf, Polo and Up!.
Used as much for work as for leisure and pleasure, these estates can take a pounding. This new version really does look and feel like the business, but is it more than just a pretty face?
It certainly has kerb appeal with elegant styling. Even the doorman at a fivestar London hotel — more used to parking Ferraris, and Bentleys — was moved unprompted to comment on how smart it looked.
Goes from rest to 62mph in 8.9 seconds — and feels faster as you go through the six-speed manual gearbox. Top speed is 135mph.
Five driving modes include comfort, normal, sport or 'eco'. I kept it mainly on sport and enjoyed plenty of power when needed, yet with a nimble, well-balanced ride on all types of road.
Excellent economy. It averaged 68.9mpg — 76.3mpg when cruising and 59.9mpg around town. CO2 emissions are a low 107g/ km. An even more frugal 78mpg BlueMotion version arrives in June.
A stop-start system helps keep fuel bills low. There's keyless entry, plus and heated seats and steering wheel for which, in this cold snap, I was very grateful.
Ample flexible interior space; slightly more than in the outgoing model, even though its exterior dimensions are slightly smaller. The three rear seats fold nearly flat for extra load lugging capability.
Smart but unfussy interior, with supportive seats that have plenty of reclining and setting options to ensure comfort for drivers and passengers of all shapes and sizes. Stylish cloth fabric on the seats with silver inserts also add to the business-like feel.
Easy to drive and intuitive to a degree that means you quickly become at home.
Five trim levels from launch: S, SE, SE Business (my vehicle), GT and R-Line. The latter two include a range topping two-litre bi-turbo TDi diesel engine with 240 bhp and four-wheel drive. From £22,215 for the saloon, but add on £1,530 for the estate.
Lots of electronic kit to keep you safe and stable on the road.
Easy-to-read dials, but VW plans an optional 12.3 in display to replace the conventional instrument cluster.
Rear cameras make reversing into the tightest of spaces much easier.
There may be a lot of technology on board but it's simply displayed on an uncluttered dashboard. The touchscreen is relatively easy to navigate.
For anyone keen on the great outdoors, a 'trailer-assist' feature helps to manoeuvre trailers more accurately.
Only diesel models are on sale at first. A frugal plug-in hybrid GTE version with a 1.4-litre TSi petrol and electric motor version is to follow in October, promising a combined range of more than 620 miles or 31 miles in pure electric mode. A beefed-up 4x4 version will hit the road in July.
Extras hiked the base price of the version I drove from £26,665 to £31,270. These included the winter pack of heated front seats, windscreen washer jets (£280), heated steering wheel (£135), heated windscreen (£150), and a whole lot more. The dynamic chassis control (£700), 18-inch anthracite alloys (£665), sound insulating glass (£310), climate control (£590), all-round cameras (£590), and a system that enables you to connect your smartphone to the car's information and entertainment system (£160).</span><span>Volkswagen Passat Estate SE Business 2.0 TDI 150PS .

The new Zetec is both effortless and nimble to drive .
Ford have listened to their customers and simplified the car's interior .
Were it not for a Press leak, this would be a test of the latest version of the Ford Fusion. That was the name planned for the mid-size hatchback, which in 1998 replaced the longrunning Escort. But Ford's then boss, the mercurial Jac Nasser, was so incensed that the cat had got out of the bag, he changed the name and revealed it just seconds before the curtains came up at its Geneva Motor Show launch. Now with 12 million sold worldwide, we're on the third generation.
Ford does so many things without fuss that it's easy to take its cars for granted. A big mistake. The company puts a great deal of attention to detail into each model. So this newcomer is both effortless and nimble to drive, but also engaging, thanks to a crisp six-speed manual gearbox linked to a willing, yet frugal and award-winning, 1-litre 125bhp EcoBoost engine.
The base price of the car I drove was £18,795, but it came with a few extras including Frozen White paint (£250), door edge protectors (£85), but most significantly the Ford Sync2 DAB navigation system (£500) with a big 8in touch-screen with on the central dashboard. It includes a splitscreen display, voice-control of audio, satnav, climate control and mobile phones, spoken street names, 3-D highway, junction and landmark views and even the Michelin guide. A chunk of money, but well worth it.
The ergonomics make it easy to sit in and drive. Buttons tend to be where you want them.
Ford said it's listened to customers who asked for simplicity inside the car with fewer controls and switches to navigate around.
So a sensible de-clutter results in a cleaner, more modern feel to the interior with black satin trim and chrome detailing. Sufficient space in the back. The boot is big enough for the weekly shop.
Good economy at around 60mpg — almost 50mpg in town, helped by stop-start technology. Acceleration from rest to 62 mph is 11 seconds which, while it won't break any speed records, is fine for family motoring. CO2 emissions are low at 108g/km.
My Zetec trim level is the third of six which range from basic Studio to Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium and Titanium X. Standard equipment includes 16 in alloy wheels, a quick-clear heated windscreen, air conditioning, remote central locking, hill-start assist, Thatcham category 1 alarm, halogen headlamps, sports-style front seats and a driver-seat lumbar adjust.
Exterior styling has been refined to make it look more streamlined, but the main brief seems to have been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Up against tough competition such as the Volkswagen Golf which, although more expensive, is a hard act to follow.
There are some handy parking aids on offer, which use ultrasonic sensors to locate parking spaces and steer the car into them automatically. Sadly on the model I tested, they were not fitted.
Having plumped for a midrange model, you might ask what else is on offer. Beyond the standard Titanium X trim there's the 135mph ST, with its 250 bhp 2-litre EcoBoost petrol engine, which hits showrooms this month from £22,195. There's also a 185 bhp diesel with a top speed of 135mph and 19in alloys, and a high-performance 320 bhp 2.3-litre allwheel drive RS — the 30th vehicle to wear the RS badge since 1968.</span><span>Ford Focus Zetec, 5-door 1.0T .

As well as driving an XE from London to Berlin for a four-part documentary, he's taken part in a high-octane test at Spa, Belgium, with the help of ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle. He said: 'My work takes me around the world, but I rarely have the time to get behind the wheel myself.' Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Rolls-Royce's official announcement that it's to build its first ever 4x4, creating hundreds of new jobs. He was present as the firm announced the multi-million pound investment at its Goodwood factory, in West Sussex, on Wednesday and hailed it as a huge vote of confidence in the UK and its economy. Rolls Royce officially announced this week that they will be building their first ever 4x4 and creating hundreds of new jobs - this photograph demonstrates how the new 4x4 could look . He said: 'The Government will do everything we can to support you because it is something the country needs more of.' The new super-luxury offroader (as imagined by Auto Express above) is set to go into production within three years, adding to a line-up which includes the Phantom and Ghost limousines and variants, plus the Wraith fastback. It will be a high-bodied allterrain vehicle with all-new aluminium architecture, which Rolls-Royce says is 'worthy of carrying the Spirit of Ecstasy into the future'.</span></div></td></tr><tr>

The car is highly rated with more emergency braking and stability control .
Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK .
Just in time for the Christmas break, I took the handsome new seven-seater Discovery Sport to Iceland — no, not the High Street frozen food chain, but a proper epic across ice and snow-covered landscapes on that Viking island south of the Arctic Circle.
We may have been promised a disco inferno near the still-smouldering volcanoes, but it was more like Ice Station Zebra on the road. I've never seen so many fur-clad parkas since a screening of the Mod film Quadrophenia.
This was no road test for sissies. I don't recall meeting any tarmac outside Reykjavik. Most of the crosscountry driving was on thick ice, thin ice, or snow. There was a constant threat of blizzard when, I'm told, visibility drops to nil. Thankfully the winter tyres and onboard safety features were up to it.
On looks alone it's a winner. It may be a replacement for the Freelander, but it's bigger, smarter, more luxurious and flexible, even though the engine and much of the underpinnings remain the same.
Great for families, thanks to fantastic flexibility. There are five seats for everyday use. But two extra ones pop up from the rear to create a magnificent seven.
The willing 2.2 litre SD4 diesel is linked to a smooth 9-speed ZF automatic gearbox and accelerates briskly from rest to 62mph in 8.4 seconds so it's pretty nimble around town and when cruising, as well as off road. Top speed is 117mph. CO2 emissions are a fair 161g/km, helped by a 'stop-start' system.
There's the option of manual override via paddles on the steering wheel. And boy did I use them as I traversed slippery glaciers and stormed up steep, snowclad hills. For winter in Britain, it'll do the job.
The hill-descent control was a godsend. It takes control of the low gearing and braking to give you a reassuringly confident descent.
It's been built with about 2ft (600mm) of wading depth, with a short overhang at the front and rear to help you cross shallow rivers and fords.
The car has achieved the top 5-star rating with more emergency braking and stability control systems than you could wave a stick at — plus a pedestrian airbag.
A comfortable and comforting interior with a commanding view of the road ahead and ample head and legroom in the back.
It goes on sale on January 22, with first deliveries set for late February.
Not the cheapest 4x4 by far and the 'extras' will soon mount up. You are paying a hefty premium for the badge and the engineering expertise behind it.
Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK, no petrol option.
There will be a 'greener' two-wheel-drive version soon, producing a 119g/km and costing less than £30,000. Great for looking the part, but frankly if you're going to buy a proper Land Rover, why have one that's not a 4x4?
The hill descent control button needs to be more prominent so you could whack it into play in transit — when you suddenly realise you need it — rather than groping to find it.</span><span>New Land Rover Discovery Sport .
