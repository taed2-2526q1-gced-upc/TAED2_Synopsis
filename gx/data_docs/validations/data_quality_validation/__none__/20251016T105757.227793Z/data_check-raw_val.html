These sides have met twice before in the Champions League quarter-final stage. The French side progressed 3-2 on aggregate in 1995, while Barcelona went through on away goals in 2013 (3-3 on agg).
Barcelona have never won in three away trips to face PSG (L2 D1), including a 3-2 defeat in this year’ group stage.
PSG have lost one and drawn two of their three visits to the Nou Camp to face Barca, including a 3-1 defeat in this year’s group stage.
Both teams have scored in six of the seven previous meetings between the sides in European competition. The only game where one team failed to score was in the 1997 Cup Winner’s Cup final, with Barcelona winning 1-0.
Lionel Messi has scored three goals in four Champions League games against the French side, while Neymar also scored in both group stage games against them this season.
Barca have lost just one of their last 11 games against French opposition, though this was against PSG this season (W6 D4).
Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid have already met six times this season with Atleti remaining unbeaten, winning four (including both league clashes) and drawing two.
Atletico Madrid have scored exactly once in all four previous European meetings with city rivals Real, winning just once and losing three.
Including this season, there has been at least one Spanish team in the Champions League quarter-final for the last 10 campaigns.
For only the third time in European Cup history, a quarter-final tie will feature two Spanish sides; however it is the second season in a row that this has happened (Real Madrid v Sevilla in 1958 and Atletico v Barcelona in 2014).
Bayern only lost 1 of 22 competitive matches versus Portuguese teams (13 W, 8 D): the European Cup final 1987: 1-2 versus Porto.
Bayern won the last knockout tie against a Portuguese team 12-1: 5-0 A and 7-1 H against Sporting in the Last 16 of the CL 2008/09.
Porto's one previous knockout European Cup victory over a German side came in the 1987 final; they have been eliminated from three knockout ties since, two against Bayern and one against Schalke.
Bayern Munich have kept seven clean sheets in their last nine against Portuguese sides, conceding just twice in total.
These two sides have only ever met before in the 97/98 Champions League, when Juventus won 4-1 at home and lost 2-3 in Monte Carlo on their way to the final where they lost 1-0 to Real Madrid.
In their 24 European meetings with French teams (including Intertoto), the Old Lady have lost just five times, winning 14 and drawing five.
However in the Champions League only, Juve has won just two of their six games against French sides (one win v Monaco in 1998 and a victory against Nantes in 1996).
In their 11 European meetings with Italian sides, Monaco have won just three times (D2 L6), although two of those victories have come in their last three clashes with Serie A sides.</div></td></tr><tr>
