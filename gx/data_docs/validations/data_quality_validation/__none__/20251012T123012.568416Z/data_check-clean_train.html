          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-1-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- An 11-year-old California girl snatched from the street in front of her house in 1991 had two children with the man accused of taking her and was forced along with the children to live in backyard sheds, police said Thursday. Jaycee Lee Dugard as she looked in 1991 and an age-progression image of what she might look like as an adult. "From what they have both said, he fathered both of those children with Jaycee [Dugard]," El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar told reporters. The girls, now 11 and 15, had been living with their mother, now 29, in a series of sheds behind Phillip Garrido's house in Antioch, California, until they were discovered on Wednesday, Kollar said. "None of the children had ever gone to school, they had never been to a doctor, they were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house," he said. "They were born there." In a rambling telephone interview from jail, Garrido told CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento he was relieved at being caught. "I feel much better now," he said. "This is a process that needed to take place." Kollar said Garrido's wife, Nancy, was with her husband when Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe. Garrido was already a registered sex offender at the time.  Watch police talk about why they arrested Garrido » . "There was nothing then nor is there anything now to indicate that this was anything other than a stranger abduction of an 11-year-old," Kollar said. The investigation went years without apparent progress until Tuesday, when Garrido showed up on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with his two daughters and attempted to get permission to hand out literature and speak, Kollar said. He did not know the subject of either the literature or the planned talk. Police officers "thought the interaction between the older male and the two young females was rather suspicious," so she confronted them and performed a background check on him, Kollar said. That check revealed that Garrido was on federal parole for a 1971 conviction for rape and kidnapping, for which he had served time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. A school spokesman identified the officers as Allison Jacobs and Lisa Campbell, and said the two became suspicious of "subtle behavior" Garrido exhibited. They passed on the information to Garrido's parole officer, who requested that the 58-year-old man appear Wednesday at the parole office. Garrido did just that, accompanied by his wife, Nancy, "and a female named Allissa," Kollar said. The presence of "Allissa" and the two children surprised the parole officer, who had never seen them during visits to Garrido's house, Kollar said. "Ultimately, Allissa was identified as Dugard," Kollar said. DNA confirmation is being sought to confirm her identity, but Dugard revealed information during an interview that only she could have known, Kollar said. "The two minor children turned out to be children of Jaycee and the male suspect, Garrido," he said. Scott Kernan, undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told reporters that Garrido admitted to having abducted Dugard. El Dorado County Sheriff's Office online records showed that Phillip and Nancy Garrido were in the county jail, held on suspicion of offenses including conspiracy to commit a crime and kidnapping with the intent to commit robbery and rape. Dugard had been living behind Garrido's home since she was kidnapped, Kollar said. But her presence there apparently went unnoticed by others in the residential neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000, said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years. "My dad said he never saw a young woman," said Russo, who added that her father, 94-year-old Dante Confetti, considered Garrido to be a "kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy." She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her family's last contact with Garrido was last fall, she said. "He was burning something in the backyard and my home health aide called the fire department," Russo said. "He was really pissed off," she said. "Came over to the house and started yelling." Garrido told KCRA that he left documents three days ago with the FBI in San Francisco, California, that would shed light on the case. "They're going to be a part of the trial," he said. A call from CNN to the FBI's San Francisco bureau was not immediately returned. Garrido said he could not go into detail about why he chose to abduct Dugard. "I haven't talked to a lawyer yet, so I can't do that," he said. But Garrido said he had "completely turned my life around" in the past several years. "You're going to find the most powerful story coming from the witness, from the victim," he said. "If you take this a step at a time, you're going to fall over backward and in the end you're going to find the most powerful, heartwarming story." He added, "Wait 'til you hear the story of what took place at this house. You're going to be absolutely impressed. It's a disgusting thing that took place with me in the beginning, but I turned my life completely around." Describing the two daughters, he said, "Those two girls slept in my arms every single night from birth; I never kissed them." But in a later comment, he said that, from the time the youngest was born, "everything turned around." Asked about the fact that they had not seen doctors, he said, "We just didn't have the finances and so forth." Kollar said a search of Garrido's property "revealed a hidden backyard within a backyard," he said. It included several sheds no higher than 6 feet tall, two tents and several outbuildings "where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives." The "secondary" backyard was inside the first and was "screened from view." One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. "The way the backyard is set up you could walk through the backyard, walk through the house and never know that there was another set of living circumstances in that backyard." At the end of the backyard is a 6-foot fence lined with shrubs, tall trees, garbage bags and a tarp, all of which obscured views of what was there, he said. Extension cords provided electricity to the sheds and tents, and an outhouse and rudimentary shower "as if you were camping" were there, too, he said. Dugard "was in good health, but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll," Kollar said. He described her as "relatively cooperative, relatively forthcoming" in discussions with detectives. He said Dugard was "in relatively good condition," neither obviously abused nor malnourished. He added, "There are no known attempts by her to outreach to anybody." The mother and her two daughters were staying at a motel in the area, he said. "Family reunification has begun and will be a long and ongoing process," he said, presumably referring to Dugard's parents. Earlier Thursday, Carl Probyn, Dugard's stepfather, told CNN that an FBI agent had called his wife, Terry, on Wednesday afternoon to tell her that Dugard had been found. "Jaycee remembers everything," he said. "They talked back and forth and she had the right answers to all my wife's questions." He said, "I'm feeling great! ... It's like winning the Lotto." He witnessed the abduction of the blond, blue-eyed girl, who was wearing a pink windbreaker and pink stretch pants as she walked to her bus stop on June 10, 1991.

At 29, Jay Chou is already a household name in many Asian countries. "I think I tend to believe in myself. I don't know....maybe I was born to believe in myself rather than in others. That's why I like to complete my work on my own," the solo singer-songwriter and actor told CNN's Talk Asia. The 29-year-old has ridden his wave of inner belief to become one of Asia's biggest pop stars, and fostered an image of being something of an anti-hero, neither boastful nor too brash. His music mixes ballads with urban R&B beats, while he has also taken a march on Asian cinema, writing his own screenplays, directing and appearing in a number of hit films. Music remains his first love, having found success despite being naturally shy. He released his first album in 2000, and eight years and seven albums later he still believes he has plenty of material for songs left in him, breaking from the usual Mando- and Canto-pop themes of boy-meets-girl. In the past his lyrics have ventured into more considered and darker territory with a song about an abusive father and have taken on a variety of themes and genres. "I think my music is quite different from the Western rap music culture. You won't find bad language in my music. I have this sense of responsibility to add an educational element in my music. That's why I would never write anything about suicide or whatever, because I think we all need the courage to deal with our lives," he said. Chou was brought up by his mother, a school teacher in Linkou in Taiwan. His parents divorced while he was at a young age. He began playing the piano as a 3-year-old, continuing to practice daily throughout his school days where despite being a diligent pupil he was academically average. While a so-so student he developed a way to express himself by focusing on playing the piano, and from it developed a self-reliant streak. "I think my confidence belongs to the stage or when I'm standing in front of the screen. I'm like two different people on-stage and off-stage," he told CNN's Talk Asia. Chou's career was given a boost when he was spotted by Taiwanese entertainer Jacky Wu while backstage before a TV talent contest. Wu liked what he saw and introduced Chou to the music industry, at first as a songwriter for others. "I never aimed to be a pop icon or whatever. My first album was actually a collection of songs that I wrote for other people. They didn't want them, so I made the album myself. The only aim I had was to be a singer-songwriter, not an idol," said Chou. Despite modest beginnings then he has reached idol status in many Asian countries, having appeared in front of crowds of tens of thousands of people across Asia and on the silver screen to millions. His huge exposure also ensures he's the sources of constant speculation from the media about his private life. "I think showbiz in Taiwan, or even in the Chinese-speaking region, is quite different from showbiz in the U.S. The more low-profile and tight-lipped you are, the more the paparazzi runs after you. And I happen to belong in this category," he said.</div></td></tr><tr>

Except for soldiers in advisory roles, all U.S. combat troops will leave Iraqi cities and towns by June 30. Army Gen. Ray Odierno said he's seen a "constant improvement" in both the security situation and governance in Iraq to prepare for the June 30 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from major cities. "They've been working for this for a long time," Odierno said on CNN's "State of the Union." In a separate interview on "Fox News Sunday," Odierno said all U.S. troops already were out of Iraq's major cities before Tuesday's deadline. "We have already moved out of the cities," Odierno said. "We've been slowly doing it over the last eight months. And the final units have moved out of the cities over the last several weeks."  Watch CNN's Michael Ware on the U.S. withdrawal » . The shift is part of the security agreement that former President George W. Bush's administration signed with Iraq. In the CNN interview, Odierno blamed the recent violence in Iraq on "extremist elements using the timeframe and date to gain attention to themselves and divert attention from the success of Iraqi security forces." The 131,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still will "maintain full coordination with Iraqi forces inside the cities" and continue to have intelligence capacity, Odierno said. With approval from the Iraqis, they also will carry out operations in major cities as necessary, he said. Odierno said his goal is to help provide security that allows Iraq to hold planned national elections leading to the eventual removal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2011. He said his biggest worry is a breakdown in stability such as a "consistent increase in violence" or a situation that Iraqi forces can't handle. "I don't see that" happening, Odierno said. "I think we're on the right path." Odierno also said Iran continues to "interfere" in Iraq, including training insurgents and paying surrogates. But he said his mission is limited to providing security within Iraq, no matter the provocation from Iran or elsewhere. "I'm not authorized to do anything outside the borders of Iraq," he said.

Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was. Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said. Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed. The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping. Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound » . "You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances," said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. "There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged." But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction. Kollar said the property had "a hidden backyard within a backyard." It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, "where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives." It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. The "secondary" backyard was inside the first and was "screened from view." One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping. Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside. She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there. "None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor," Kollar said. "They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house," he said. "They were born there." The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11. "They are all in good health," Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- Harold Pinter, the Nobel Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter whose absurdist and realistic works displayed a despair and defiance about the human condition, has died, according to British media reports. He was 78. The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007. Pinter's wife, Lady Antonia Fraser, confirmed his death. Pinter, who had been suffering from cancer, died on Christmas Eve, according to the reports. Fraser told the Guardian newspaper: "He was a great, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten." Pinter was known for such plays as "The Birthday Party" (1957), "The Homecoming" (1964), "No Man's Land" (1974), "Mountain Language" (1988), and "Celebration" (2000). The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary "Pinter pause" -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations. His movie credits, like his plays, span the decades and include "The Quiller Memorandum" (1965) and "The French Lieutenant's Woman" (1981). Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play "Betrayal," the story of a doomed love affair told backward, which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge. He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005. Pinter's later plays were more overtly political, with works such as "One for the Road" (1984) and "The New World Order" (1991) focusing on state torture. In commentaries, he became a blistering critic of the United States, writing in his Nobel lecture that the country "quite simply doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead, the pathetic and supine Great Britain." But Pinter could also be a man of great humor. In 2006, he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier. "Two days later, I woke up to find that I'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature," he said. "So life is really full of ups and downs, you see." Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10, 1930. He was the son of Jewish immigrants, his father a dressmaker, his mother "a wonderful cook," he once recalled. In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, then as now one of Great Britain's most renowned drama schools. But the RADA didn't take; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms. He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work, "The Room," in 1957. Later that year he wrote "The Birthday Party," a "comedy of menace," in the words of one critic, that helped make Pinter's reputation -- though, in an irony he could appreciate, after it closed in London due to scathing notices. Ensuing Pinter plays, including "The Dumb Waiter" (1957) and "The Homecoming," made him Britain's most famous playwright, as influential to "late 20th-century British theater [as] Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages," CNN.com's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006. "What's generally meant as a 'Pinter play' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted, even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat," Anderson wrote. Pinter's plays featured sparse dialogue, often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement. In "The Birthday Party," a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it's his birthday; in "The Homecoming" -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family, where the wife becomes the center of attention. Pinter credited Samuel Beckett, among others, as an influence. (He starred in a production of Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" in 2006.) In turn, writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter's elliptical lead. "One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness," Pinter once said. He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant. Following a 1980 divorce, Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- Lindsay Spencer was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life: what to do with those Facebook friend requests from people she met through her job. Blurring work and personal friendships is prompting Lindsay Spencer to maintain separate Facebook pages. "There's nothing on my personal page that's horrible," says the 24-year-old communications coordinator for the National Peanut Board in Atlanta, Georgia. "It's just that there are some things that are not work-appropriate." Many of the job-related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences. Eventually they would find her by searching on Facebook and request to be "friended." Initially Spencer decided to ignore the requests. After all, does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are? Do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time? Spencer's answer was to create a second Facebook page, which she devotes to work-related information. This means she now has her "friend friends," about 400 of them, and then she has her "work friends," four, so far. Spencer's modern dilemma is becoming more common throughout the world, experts say, as friendships with co-workers extend to our lives spent online after work hours. Simultaneously, our computer time at the office is becoming an extension of our personal life, they say. 'Work takes place in more places now' This isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York. "No one ever forces us to go online -- we can shut it off," he says. "What this is really all about is an increase in information sharing." And with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices, many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail. They also have the ability to stay in constant touch with their favorite social networking sites. "There is increasingly less difference in work life and personal time," Levinson says. "We are coming from a time when there were very clear boundaries. That comes from an older expectation. Work takes place in more places now." And again, Levinson doesn't think it's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers. Spencer, who has friended her manager but not her big boss, says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites. And so far, so good. There have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades, no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts. Social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world, says Dr. Lynn Friedman, a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University. Face time vs. Facebook time . People can use the sites to make new acquaintances outside their departments and groups, and users can extend their networks beyond the traditional workplace, she says in an interview by e-mail. "It's a way to enter new professional galaxies." But people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person. "In most businesses, it's optimal to mix social networking with real-life face-to-face interaction," she writes. "However, social networking can provide a springboard for identifying kindred spirits with whom one might want to do something old-fashioned like, say, having a cup of coffee. In an ideal world, it's best to relate to others in both cyber and real space." Paula Pile, a psychologist who practices in North Carolina, says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites aren't encroaching on your office time. More than an hour a day is excessive, she warns. Worse, spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time. It can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children. "If you are spending two hours at home on them each night, you are not available to your family," she says. Set boundaries . Both psychologists advise setting boundaries between yourself and the people you work with, as well as your online "friends." Friedman also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings. She uses an example of someone who lets people know, "I don't do those things at nights or on weekends so I can have my time with family." And Pile says to consider who you're corresponding with during your work time. If they aren't people you would talk to in "real life," she says, you probably are wasting time.</div></td></tr><tr>

Georgian soldiers on a tank watch a Russian attack on a convoy outside Gori on Monday. If Russia brings its full military might to bear on its former satellite state, the Georgian military could find itself overcome quickly. Jane's Information Group, the British-based defense publications and military intelligence company, shows the Georgian military would be trying to hold off a force more than 20 times its size. Russia has about 641,000 in its armed forces, 320,000 of whom are in the army -- most of them conscripts who traditionally fare poorly against a motivated opponent, according to Jane's. Low morale, poor management, inefficiency and inflexibility are cited as problems by Jane's.  Watch how Russia takes over Georgian city » . About 26,000 are in the Georgian military, and about 17,000 of them are in the army, which has had the benefit of four years of training by the U.S. Marines, Army and Special Forces, according to Jane's. Georgia has been trying to form a professional military force and by the end of next year expected to have only a small number of conscripts in its main force, Jane's said. Those forces would be using almost all Soviet-era weaponry. The Tbilisi government has been seeking western armaments but has been told by Washington that forces must be able to use the old weapons proficiently before they get new ones, Jane's reported. Even with those old weapons, Georgia doesn't have much to work with. Its best tanks are Soviet-era T-72s, of which it has about 80, according to Jane's. The Georgian army has about 150 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles and a similar number of artillery pieces. The sharp end of the Georgian air force consists of seven aging Su-25 ground attack fighters and seven attack helicopters, according to Jane's. Russia's weaponry is formidable. It has about 7,000 tanks, 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and thousands of pieces of artillery, Jane's reports. In the air, Russia can bring 650 multirole or ground attack aircraft to the battle, as well as 500 attack helicopters. Georgia has 150 surface-to-air missiles to use in the fight, according to Jane's. Of course, Russia's military is spread across a country of 10.58 million square miles (17 million square kilometers), 243 times the size of Georgia.

It catapulted her to international success and stardom, something she had always wanted, but at first found difficult to adjust to. "We were really on a whole kind of roller coaster with [Eurythmics], which on the one hand I was very grateful for, and on the other hand, it sort of sucked out your life, any sort of privacy," she said. "Just the ability to be anonymous which I absolutely really value. I love to just to be mixing with people and not have to be the one person in the room with the spotlight and the heads all turning. So that was a little bit hard to adapt to...I might as well have a neon light for a head." She's sold over 80 million records during a career that has spanned four decades, which she credits to hard graft fueled by an unending passion for music. "The glamour side to it is what we see as the end result. But all the rest of it is hard work and dedication. And it's not easy always, you have to be very focused. And you have to be really, really motivated to do it. You have to have a kind of yearning, a passion for that. "I was never thinking, 'Oh, I'm in this for the long haul.' I just think as I'm still thinking, I want to have a life where I'm able to do the thing that makes me feel alive." Aware of the downsides of a career in music, Lennox also has a greater sense of the perils and pitfall in life, something she has often expressed in her music. "I have encountered individuals and I've encountered things in the industry that were vile. Bad things happen everywhere. And the music industry and all that surrounds it, is no exception.". Having experienced unscrupulous people in the music industry and been through her own personal upheaval through two failed marriages, Lennox remain passionate, energetic and sanguine.

Between them, they engulf most of the grievances and violence that shape the Islamic world and its relations with the United States. Intense U.S. involvement will be needed to help resolve both of the conflicts. This will require imagination, creative out-of-the-box diplomacy, and the courage to see it through both from the United States and leaders on the ground. Going back even to the status-quo ante will no longer be sufficient. The 30-year-old rupture in relations between the United States and Iran is also expected to be addressed as a key priority by the new administration. Both the president-elect and his secretary of state-designate have said they want to abandon the silent treatment and isolation of previous administrations and try engaging Iran, as a way of resolving difficult issues such as its nuclear program and its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.

German special police patrol in Berlin last month during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu. A State Department travel alert, issued Wednesday, remains in effect until November 11 -- two weeks after Germany holds its federal elections on Sunday. Al Qaeda posted its video threat on the Internet on September 18, vowing attacks if the elections do not come out the way it wants. The same day, the German government reacted to the video by raising its own alert level and heightening security. The British Foreign Office has also issued an advisory to its citizens living and traveling to Germany. The State Department travel alert asks Americans to keep abreast of news reports and consider the security procedures in place when they visit public places or pick hotels and restaurants. Germany's interior ministry said earlier this month that the country has noted an increase in threats by al Qaeda and other Islamist groups since the beginning of the year. In the nearly 26-minute video statement, a man identified as Bekay Harrach, using the pseudonym Abu Talha and speaking in German, said that, if the September 27 elections vote into power parties that do not pledge to pull German troops from Afghanistan, there will be a "rude awakening." The speaker called on Muslims living in Germany to stay away from public life during the first two weeks after the elections, implying that any attacks would take place then. The speaker repeatedly criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

CNN photojournalist Peter Morris and I just wrapped up spending several days in southern Afghanistan with Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps, touring the combat zone. The Marines are living in some of the toughest terrain there is. It is remote and often raining. That means dust turns to mud, and you find yourself covered in it from head to toe. Stinky, cold, wet, oozy mucky mud. The good news is, everybody stinks, so you lose any sense of self-consciousness about it. But you do dream of getting power-washed. So, yes, after a few days a shower was, shall we say, more than essential. For the Marines, however, it is a seven-month tour of duty in mud in the winter and dust in the summer. It seems very grim, especially when compounded by the fact that the Marines are wearing heavy body armor all the time. Ask them if it's heavy to wear, the typical answer goes something like, "It's only heavy to wear until the bad guys start shooting at you. Then it's OK." The young Marines know exactly how tough the fight they are facing in the coming weeks and months will likely be. Several of them told me security had gotten considerably worse in recent days. Their bases were being repeatedly shelled by insurgents, several roadside bombs had gone off, and local Afghan police had died at the hands of suicide attacks. Senior commanders usually have a more cheery outlook, but here in southern Afghanistan, everyone is cautious. Almost everyone is a veteran of Iraq and learned the tough lesson there about not declaring victory too soon. Even Conway, who commanded U.S. forces in Fallujah, picks his words very carefully. He tells me he believes that everyone must be ready for a spike in U.S. casualties as the Marines begin to move into the region in greater numbers this spring. All of this was rattling around in my head when I saw the Marines riding around in what they call "a 7-ton truck." As the name suggests, it's huge and has some armor plating on the sides. But what it doesn't make clear is that the truck is open in the back and sides. The Marines insist it is a safe way to transport troops. For years now, the Army has used fully armored vehicles only in the combat zone. The Marines have a somewhat different view. They believe heavy armor isn't everything; sometimes being able to get around on the battlefield faster is better. But then again, when someone starts shooting at you, I think you want all the armor you can get. Next stop, Iraq. Yeah, there is still a war there, too.</div></td></tr><tr>

His most recent book is "The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader." Peter Bergen says it's crucial to correctly frame the nature of a war before beginning it. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency, his inaugural address. One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the "war on terror." The dean of military strategists, Carl von Clausewitz, explains the importance of this decision-making in his treatise "On War": "The first, the supreme, the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish...the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature." Clausewitz's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open-ended and ambiguous "war on terror" after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Bush took the nation to war against a tactic, rather than a war against a specific enemy, which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it. When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U-boats and kamikaze pilots, but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan. The war on terror, sometimes known as the "Global War on Terror" or by the clunky acronym GWOT, became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions. That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels. The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq. It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists, including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied, and that he therefore threatened American interests. None of this, of course, turned out to be true. The Bush administration's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines, spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism. It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which, in early 2006, the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory, propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s. Imprisoned by its war on terror framework, the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country, yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered. As is now widely understood in Israel, the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government. Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself. Under the banner of the war on terror, the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran. In 2006, for instance, President Bush claimed that "the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat." In reality, Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq. The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States, which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11, while Shiite militants have never done so. So, how to reconceptualize the GWOT? Contrary to a common view among Europeans, who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades, al Qaeda is not just another criminal/terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone. After all, a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people. By contrast, al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden's 1997 interview with CNN. Following that declaration of war, the terror group attacked American embassies, a U.S. warship, the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States, killing thousands of civilians without warning; acts of war by any standard. Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT, the Global Police Action Against Terrorists, would be foolish and dangerous. What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda? For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration. Nine days after 9/11, Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps "of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century...They follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism," implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War. For the Bush administration, painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler's arch-appeaser, Neville Chamberlain. But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought. The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions. And when the United States fought the Nazis, the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers. In his inaugural address, Obama should say that the United States is indeed at "war against al Qaeda and its allies," but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists, then the U.S. has won against them. Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas, but they are far from all-powerful. Barring an exceptional event like September 11, 2001, in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack. Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War. There are relatively few adherents of Binladen-ism in the West today, while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism. Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of "Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists," the Obama administration doctrine will be, "Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us." After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe. Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution, government and ethnic grouping.

Alberto Pizango, a leader of the protesters, says his followers did not kill police officers. Police and indigenous protesters said separately that at least eight police and 22 protesters died. The clash took place at dawn outside the northern province of Bagua in the Department of Amazonas as police attempted to break up a roadblock on the 59th day of protests. Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Español that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters. Under the state of emergency, the army can be called on to maintain order. "Look, the use of force is legitimate," he said. "Today, what we have received in response were gunshots -- directed at police helicopters, killing eight or nine police." But Alberto Pizango, the principal leader of the indigenous group, said his followers could not have been responsible for killing any police, because they were armed only with stones and arrows. He said the demonstrators had been pursuing a peaceful protest. Authorities have not confirmed the number of civilian deaths. The director general of the police, Jose Sanchez Farfan, said government buildings in Bagua had been looted and set aflame. Though a congressional commission has recommended the repeal of the laws rejected by the native communities, President Alan Garcia supports those that allow using the lands, maintaining that the richness of the Amazon belongs to all Peruvians and that a significant percentage of natural areas are already protected. "These people don't have crowns," he said about the protesters. "These people aren't first-class citizens who can say -- 400,000 natives to 28 million Peruvians -- 'You don't have the right to be here.' No way. That is a huge error." Garcia called Pizango a criminal. Several days ago, Garcia announced an arrest warrant had been issued for Pizango, who is accused of inciting his followers to violence.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">LONDON, England (CNN) -- New data released Thursday suggests that the Arctic Ocean will be "largely ice free" during summer within a decade. As the Arctic sea ice melts, polar bears face extinction. The report, complied by the UK-based Catlin Arctic Survey and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is the latest research into ice thickness in the Arctic. Researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months. The expedition, which was completed in May, was led by UK explorer Pen Hadow. He and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450-kilometer route across the northern part of the Beaufort Sea. They found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice. Scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older, thicker ice. "Discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80-85 percent free waters in the Arctic Ocean," Hadow told CNN. Measurements taken by Hadow and his team report that the ice-floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which, according to scientists, is too thin to survive next summer's ice melt. Professor Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the UK's University of Cambridge said: "With a large part of the region now first year ice, it is clearly more vulnerable. The area is now more likely to become open water each summer, bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone." Professor Wadhams, who has analyzed the expedition data, added: "The Catlin Arctic Survey data supports the new consensus view that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years."  Click here to see pictures of the expedition » . Martin Sommerkorn from the WWF International Arctic Program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further. "Such a loss of Arctic sea ice has recently been assessed to set in motion powerful climate feedbacks which will have an impact far beyond the Arctic itself," Sommerkorn said. "Arctic sea ice holds a central position in our Earth's climate system. Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world," he added. Hadow fears that the current climate models developed by scientists may not be extreme enough. But he is hopeful that this new data will spur world leaders into action. "We are now in a loss period," Hadow told CNN. "Maybe losing this sea ice, this roof on the top of our planet in going to be an important moment, a big visual aid to the science that in combination can bring about some sort of global agreement on emissions."</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">LONDON, England (CNN) -- When people think of coffee, words such as caffeine, aroma and energy may spring to mind. 'Good breath,' however, certainly isn't one of them. Mel Rosenberg at work in his 'smell laboratory' found that coffee can lead to good breath. So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel, were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath, showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath. Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt, or smelt. "Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath," Rosenberg told CNN "and as a latte drinker, I believe that too." But the malodor doesn't necessarily come from the coffee itself, said Rosenberg: "We think that coffee, which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth, can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk." This meant that until recently, coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast, not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors. But until Rosenberg's study, no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath. Rosenberg's team wanted to prove just that. They did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the Israeli brand Elite coffee, Landwer Turkish coffee, and Taster's Choice. "We thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor, but incredibly it had the opposite effect." Rosenberg -- who also created popular mouthwash Dentyl pH -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash, toothpaste, or chewing gum based on coffee. The effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil, which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath. But first Rosenberg would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties. "That will take a long time" said Rosenberg. "But this research has already been a lesson in humility, showing that assumptions are not always correct." Rosenberg -- who also writes children's books such as 'Mel the Smell Dragon' -- told CNN.

Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags. The law affects all stores, production facilities and service providers within the Federal District, which encompasses the city limits. Nearly 9 million people live inside the district and another 10 million reside in surrounding communities that make up greater Mexico City. Mexico City becomes the second large metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw the bags. San Francisco in March 2007 enacted an ordinance that gave supermarkets six months and large chain pharmacies about a year to phase out the bags. Los Angeles is set to impose a ban if the state of California does not enact a statewide 25-cent fee per bag by July. About 90 percent of the bags used in the United States are not recycled. Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries. China has adopted a strict limit, reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags, the World Watch Institute said, citing government estimates. Although compliance has been spotty, violation of the law carries a possible fine of 10,000 yuan ($1,463), World Watch said. In Tanzania, selling the bags carries a maximum six-month jail sentence and a fine of 1.5 million shilling ($1,137). Mumbai, India, outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in Australia, Italy, South Africa and Taiwan have imposed bans or surcharges. Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one. Some leading environmentalists are calling for a global ban on the bags. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says plastic bags are the second-most-common form of litter, behind cigarette butts. The bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe's oceans, the U.N. agency said in a recent report. The bags are also a major threat to ocean wildlife, causing the deaths of 100,000 sea turtles and other marine animals that mistake them for food. "Thin-film, single-use plastic bags, which choke marine life, should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere," Steiner said in June. "There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore, anywhere." Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a "deep shame" and called it "gravely immoral behavior." "Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations," he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue » . "It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm," he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. "What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a "moral renewal." Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States "a nation of prayer." Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, "In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed." Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. "From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator," he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip » . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as "The Star-Spangled Banner." A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including "Yankee Doodle," and soprano Kathleen Battle sang "The Lord's Prayer." The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with "Happy Birthday" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like » . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called "one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House." Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive "popemobile." His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign » . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1½-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? » . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members.

President Obama (right) praised Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House on Friday. "I obviously have extraordinary admiration for the courage and tenacity that the prime minister has shown in navigating through some very difficult political times in Zimbabwe," Obama said. "There was a time when Zimbabwe was the breadbasket of Africa, and [it] continues to have enormous potential. It has gone through a very dark and difficult time politically." Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe "has not acted oftentimes in the best interest of the Zimbabwean people and has been resistant to the democratic changes that need to take place," Obama said. "We now have a power-sharing agreement that shows promise, and we want to do everything we can to encourage the kinds of improvement not only on human rights and rule of law, freedom of the press and democracy that is so necessary, but also on the economic front." The U.S. aid will not be going to the government directly "because we continue to be concerned about consolidating democracy, human rights and rule of law," Obama said. "But it will be going directly to the people in Zimbabwe." In a CNN interview following his meeting with Obama, Tsvangirai said he is grateful for the generosity. "Whether it is humanitarian aid or transitional support, it adds up to the relief that Zimbabwe is seeking," he said.  Watch Tsvangirai discuss importance of aid to Zimbabwe » . Tsvangirai said he told Obama he would like the United States to use its global influence to assist Zimbabwe in dealing with the challenges it faces. Tsvangirai said he understood other nations' reluctance to support the Zimbabwean government, given Mugabe's controversial history. "I think it's fair," he said. "I understand it, given our history, and I'm not going to defend President Mugabe." But, he noted, the two have agreed to work together and help Zimbabwe progress as a nation. In remarks with Obama, Tsvangirai said progress has been made by the transitional government, but much remains to be done. "It is the problems of implementation," he said. "... even by the standard of our own benchmarks, there are gaps that still exist." He said he would continue to strive to meet those benchmarks, not for the international community, but because "it gives [the] people of Zimbabwe freedom and opportunity to grow." The power-sharing arrangement between Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, and Mugabe came after contested elections last year. "Of course we cannot brush away that history, that sad history," Tsvangirai told CNN. But he said he is hoping the country will heal and move forward, and wants even those skeptical of Mugabe to appreciate the transition process. Asked whether he believes Mugabe should retire, Tsvangirai said "at the age of 85, I think one needs to retire." But, he said, for his own legacy, it's important for him to be thinking about a "dignified exit." "I think that [the power-sharing government] provides him with this opportunity," Tsvangirai said. Asked about his relationship with Mugabe, he said, "We don't have to fall in love to work together. But we have accepted that we have made an agreement to have a workable relationship between the two political parties." He said there had been acrimony between the two, but they realized it was not helping the Zimbabwean people. "We are inspired by people like Nelson Mandela, who had to go for 27 years in jail but still come out and say, 'Let's forget about the past' ..." he said. He and Mugabe have chosen the process of dialogue rather than violence, Tsvangirai said. "Let history judge whether this historic experiment was the right course of action."

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two popular anti-smoking drugs will now carry warnings about the risk of severe mental health problems, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. "Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death," an FDA official said. The FDA said Chantix and Zyban will carry the warnings to alert consumers to the risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when using the drugs. The drugs also have been reported to cause changes in behavior, hostility and agitation in users, whether users had a history of psychiatric illness or not. In many cases, side effects started shortly after use began and ended when the medication was stopped. The FDA does not know what is causing the changes and said people taking these products should be monitored by their doctor. "The risk of serious adverse events while taking these products must be weighed against the significant health benefits of quitting smoking," said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the United States, and we know these products are effective aids in helping people quit." The agency also is requiring Pfizer Inc., which makes Chantix, and GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Zyban, to conduct a study looking at how often these serious symptoms occur. Pfizer says it updated its label in 2007 to include information of neuropsychiatric symptoms and has revised the label again to reflect Wednesday's warning. "The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about Chantix and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely," said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president of the primary care development group at Pfizer. "Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health, but the quitting process is both difficult and complex." The FDA says that since Chantix was approved in 2006, the agency has had reports of 98 suicides and 188 attempted suicides. Zyban has had reports of 14 suicides and 17 attempts. Zyban contains the same active ingredient as the antidepressant Wellbutrin and already carried a box warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. Neither Chantix nor Zyban contains nicotine, and the FDA said some symptoms could be the result of nicotine withdrawal. Still, the agency said, people using these drugs experienced some of these symptoms while they were still smoking. In a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch, the agency said it didn't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events.</div></td></tr></tbody>

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-1-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- A young woman stands against a crisp black backdrop. The photographer walks forward and gently turns her away from the camera. Today the focus is not on her face but on the delicate architectural feat that sits atop her head. It seems to almost defy gravity, with light radiating from the hair tower as it spirals upwards in a conical shape. Hairstyles have long been popular fashion statements for Nigerian women. But over the years, the intricate braiding and eye-catching sculptures have often reflected the country's changing sociopolitical times as well. And for the last six decades, one man made it his life's work to capture the complex refashioning of his homeland. In February, the renowned artist J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere died at his home in Lagos aged 84. He left behind a remarkable body of work, much of which is largely unknown outside Nigeria. But now, many of Ojeikere's countrymen are putting in a renewed effort to celebrate the life of the beloved artist -- through documentary films, exhibitions and an impressive monograph of work, Nigeria is presenting J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere to the world one last time. "He started taking images of a nation that was in the throes of development [and] independence in 1960," explains Bisi Silva, the founder and director of the Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos. "We discovered oil, money... modern buildings were going up. So he documented that process, that transition into a modernizing nation." A final wish for a departed friend . Over the last five years, Silva has been working tirelessly to complete an extensive monograph on Ojeikere. This has not been yet another project for the art curator -- Ojeikere was a close friend, and the duo had been collaborating on the monograph up until his untimely passing in February. "I had a very close relationship with 'Pa Ojeikere,' as we call him here," says Silva, who turned to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise funds for publishing the book. "I used to speak to him at least once a week." Silva recalls Ojeikere's passion and enthusiasm for the project and, holding it close to her heart, she says she's determined to finish what they had started together. "He was really dynamic, really passionate about photography and there was so much to learn in his archive. Over the last five years, we became friends. He was like a father to me. "It was just such a big shock that he passed away. That he wouldn't see the book he was extremely excited about." Documenting independence . Born in a small rural village in West Nigeria in 1930, Ojeikere would become one of Nigeria's most celebrated artists. For over 60 years, the master photographer fastidiously immersed himself in capturing his homeland, documenting every facet of daily life. His many photographs would come together to create a striking anthropological study of Nigeria. The 1950s saw a young Ojeikere searching for a vocation. Rejected by the army, it was an uncle who inadvertently put him on a lifelong journey by suggesting photography. Starting small, the untrained amateur would photograph women in his village as they donned their Sunday best and headed to church. Later on, Ojeikere got a job as a darkroom assistant at the Nigerian Ministry of Information. When he wasn't working, he was often found at the local university, snapping moments between students, staff and events on campus -- once again capturing daily life on film. The country was moving toward a time of social change and political upheaval and Ojeikere explored this through his lens. "You're getting a sort of history of Nigeria at a very important, transitional period, just on the cusp of independence," says Silva. "And just after independence [in 1960], when there is a feeling of euphoria, feeling of liberation, the sense of 'now we can conquer the world, we can develop the nation; we are free, we are independent.' "And this all comes out in the way in which individuals and people presented themselves. It's like: 'Look at me. I'm fashionable, I'm modern, I'm confident, I'm educated. I'm a professional.' All these images amount to a visual image of Nigeria in the 50s, 60s and 70s." Not just hair . Ojeikere's next job was working for the national television station, a career move that enabled him to rub shoulders with other creative minds. This is when he started to take photographs with more artistic intent, explains Silva. "He started coming into contact other artists, filmmakers, writers and that's why as he developed, the artistic intent as opposed to the anthropological intent began to develop. When we finally get to 'Hairstyles,' they are actually done in a very specific manner. It wasn't someone on the street. It was in a studio with a specific lighting, with a specific position." The "Hairstyles" series, for which he is so critically acclaimed, features over 1,000 photographs of Nigerian styles since 1954. But for Silva, his work documenting traditional Nigerian headgear and the country's architecture, as well as his studio portrait work, must be examined alongside "Hairstyles" to fully comprehend Ojeikere's legacy. The images communicate a transition from the normal photographs depicting Africa, says Silva. "The images we are used to seeing of Africa -- they gave a one dimensional perspective of a race, of a nation, of a people. It's been a herculean work to bring this publication together." Final tributes . Silva's monograph is just one tribute to Ojeikere. Nigerian filmmaker Tam Fiofori recently released "J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere: Master Photographer," a documentary capturing the final year of the artist's life. Elsewhere, an exhibition of "Hairstyles" is currently shown across the UK. Curated by Gillian Fox, it is the first time audiences in the country are having the chance to view Nigeria from this perspective. "As a Nigerian, he wanted to document that moment in Nigeria when it was a time of colonial rule changing over to democracy," says Fox. "He was keen in the wake of modernization to capture something that was quite intrinsic to his culture, his nation and he saw the rate of change that was happening and he thought hairstyles were fascinating and an art form in their own right," she continues. "They were something that should be preserved because the thing about a hairstyle is that they are really ephemeral." She adds: "I think it was a love letter to his country. He used photography which is a very modern medium to document these moments of social change." Click through the gallery above to explore some of Ojeikere's iconic photographs.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards admitted Friday to having an extramarital affair in 2006 with a woman who worked on his campaign. National Enquirer editor-in-chief David Perel says the tabloid broke news of John Edwards' affair in 2007. Edwards has denied being the father of the woman's child, as had been alleged in tabloid reports, and it is willing to take a paternity test. Wolf Blitzer, filling in for Larry King, spoke with David Perel, editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, who originally broke the story in October 2007. Blitzer also spoke with Alan Butterfield, a senior reporter for the National Enquirer who confronted John Edwards at a hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday. Some highlights: . Wolf Blitzer: What got you guys going in this direction to begin with? David Perel: We received what we thought was a credible tip, Wolf, and we started investigating it. A lot of times when we go down this road and the story turns out not to be true, we abandon it. But the more we dug in, the more information The Enquirer uncovered that was standing up, we were able to prove that, indeed, John Edwards had a sexual affair with Rielle Hunter. We first did the story in October without naming her and then we came back with a much tougher story in December 2007, where we not only named her, but we photographed her pregnant. Blitzer: And at that time, you didn't report that -- what you reported subsequently, that you thought that he was the father. Perel: That's true. We know that Rielle believes that he is the father. And Mr. Edwards today, in his own statement, said he did not take a paternity test. He's now saying that he will take one. We've asked him for months if he would take one and he's ignored that request. However, we do know the man that has claimed to be the father, Andrew Young, who worked for Mr. Edwards, our sources -- the same sources that led us to uncover this affair -- say that Rielle says she never had a sexual relationship with him.  Watch Perel discuss Edwards' "character issue" » . Blitzer: (Edwards) said in his statement today, "I only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby. I also have not been engaged in any kind of activity of any description that requested, agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby." He does say he would be more than happy to go ahead and have this paternity test, which he says would clear him. Allen, he argues that he had this affair back in 2006. The baby was born just a few weeks ago. He said the affair lasted in 2006, but there was no more affair in 2007. And, as a result, he says he couldn't be the father of this baby. Butterfield: Right. But why is he -- the question we should all ask him, then, why was he visiting her at 3 in the morning at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 21, then if he's not the father? He is the father. I mean at least he believes he's the father. Like David Perel said, that Rielle is telling everyone he's the father and he is -- you know, why isn't there a name on the birth certificate? There are still a lot of questions that Mr. Edwards needs to answer. Blitzer: And this other Andrew Young, who says he's the father, you don't believe him. Butterfield: No. Not at all. Andrew Young and his wife, Shari, moved out to the Santa Barbara area with Rielle soon after our December story. I guess they're all living, then, as one big happy family.  Watch Butterfield says he thinks Edwards fathered a love child » . Blitzer: What happens, David, if he does take the paternity test and it doesn't match and it shows he is not the father? Perel: We'll publish that. I've made the offer to him repeatedly: take a paternity test, whatever the results are, we'll publish it. He has refused to do that, as he's been calling this story lies and tabloid trash and lying to the American public. Unfortunately, I think the only reason he came forward and admitted the affair is because we did catch him at the hotel meeting on July 21 and we did publish a photograph this week in the National Enquirer showing him holding the baby. We can also reveal that in addition to that meeting, he met at the same hotel a month before with Rielle Hunter and the baby, so his actions are what counts. His words have proven not to be credible. Blitzer: I guess a lot of people question the reporting of the "National Enquirer," in part, David, because you pay sources for information, is that right? Perel: Wolf, we do pay sources for information after it checks out as credible and accurate. I think, in retrospect, nobody can deny the accuracy of these stories. We've been reporting on the affair for about 10 months now. He says his statements were 99 percent truthful and yet he told the American public while running for the highest office in the land that he did not have an affair, that these were lies, lies? This is a character issue, and he still insists he's 99 percent truthful? I think the truest thing that he said today in his statement was when he admitted that he's narcissistic. Blitzer: Did you pay any sources in connection with this particular story involving John Edwards? Perel: Wolf, we pay for photographs. We pay for information when it's accurate. We have no problem doing that. And in this story, you know, whether we did or we didn't, I'm not going to say. It doesn't matter. You can assume we did. The thing that counts is the story has proven to be true and there is more to come.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Facebook have all released their workforce diversity reports in the past few weeks. These reports have sparked much hand-wringing about the low number of African-Americans and Latinos who are working in Silicon Valley tech companies. We expect to see a tide of more reports, illustrating a dismal situation needing attention. But, too often, stunned commentators overlook a simple fact: This problem is fixable. Tech companies need more workers, and African-American and Latino communities need more work. Silicon Valley has an insatiable demand for genius. Communities of color have an untapped supply of it. Putting aside any blaming or shaming, tech leaders and communities of color could greatly benefit by coming together -- to ensure that America stops wasting so much genius. Neither Silicon Valley nor low-opportunity communities can afford it anymore. For instance: 70% of "Googlers" are men, 30% women; 61% are white and 30% are Asian. Blacks and Hispanics? Only 2% and 3%, respectively. Google's May 2014 report could best be summed up with the company's own words: "We're not where we want to be." These reports have their place. But let us first keep in mind: As important as transparency is, simply releasing these numbers won't solve the problem. In fact, Intel, one of the world's largest tech companies, has been openly sharing its diversity stats for the past decade -- and should be applauded for doing so. And yet the company still struggles with hiring minority talent. Only one thing will make a difference: a job-training pipeline specifically designed to identify, recruit and train talented people from nontraditional backgrounds and low-opportunity communities. Black Girls CODE hosts its first hackathon . Imagine, if you will, a promising black or Latino child, sitting behind a public school desk in East Oakland. That youth is seated just half an hour's drive from Silicon Valley. But it would take something like a miracle for that child to ever find her way into a coding education program, let alone an internship or job at the world's most famous tech companies, right down the road. We need to fix this -- and we can. We won't have to start from scratch. Many grass-roots educational organizations are already working to solve this problem. They are inventing and pioneering powerful new models to bring coding education to new constituencies. Unfortunately, none has reached the necessary scale. America desperately needs an efficient solution for diversifying talent in the tech sector. If existing programs could work together in smart ways, with the best ones getting support to scale up dramatically, we could create a process that would pull extraordinary talent out of unlikely places, like Oakland, or East Los Angeles, or a Native American reservation, or, for that matter, Appalachia. One effort to create those synergies and build that pipeline is called #YesWeCode, an initiative I helped start. Our goal is to help grass-roots groups train 100,000 low-opportunity youth to become high-level computer coders. Here is how we're doing it: . Exposure: First, #YesWeCode, with the help of Facebook, is creating an online platform to unite more than 70 tech-training organizations, so young people can easily and conveniently connect to coding education programs. Training: Second, we are investing in workforce development programs that target people who wouldn't normally have access or the opportunity to enter careers in tech. Our model includes "boot camps" and accelerated tech-training programs to equip young people with the skills they need to succeed in a high-level tech job. Jobs: Most important, we are establishing an employers' council to ensure this pipeline results in gainful employment. This council is also building the core movement to open the doors to invite more low-opportunity talent into this pipeline. Top executives at companies like Apple and Facebook have already expressed interest in joining this council and making meaningful changes in their workforce. Our nation is sitting on an untapped goldmine of talent: amazing young people who have the creativity and the courage, but need the skills. For example, take Kalimah Priforce. He is a young Haitian-American man who grew up in group homes. After his younger brother was shot and killed behind their childhood elementary school, he made a lifelong commitment to transforming the lives of young people. At 16 years old, he founded a tech company to serve low-income neighborhoods. Kalimah went on to co-found Qeyno Labs, a start-up that works to close the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) gap in education. This past February, Kalimah created a pioneering "hackathon" in Oakland, California, to highlight black male achievement. Young black kids came together for three days to connect, create and code. It was a group of hoodie-wearing, laptop-wielding future Mark Zuckerbergs -- who all look a bit like Trayvon Martin. It was, almost certainly, a sign of things to come. Plenty of other low-opportunity young people are waiting to live out their own success story. That's a problem we can solve. We just need to give them the opportunity. Imagine urban youth who are not just downloading apps, but uploading them. And when they succeed, they will change a lot more than the workplace diversity numbers in Silicon Valley.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(OPRAH.com) -- On my 24th birthday, my boyfriend since college proposed. While it was the happiest moment in my life so far, I was not allowed to enjoy it for very long. Within minutes, phone calls, text messages, BBMs and emails began flooding in, asking when the wedding would be. Immediately, the focus was turned away from our commitment to a lifetime together and toward the overwhelming and incredibly exciting process of planning the party. When it comes to getting married, I imagine every bride finds it very easy to get caught up in the party-planning element of things. After all, this is meant to be the one day in a girl's life when she can be a total princess -- here's to hoping I can avoid Bridezilla status, and that there will, in fact, be more princess days left in store -- so everything must be perfect. Whether you're planning an intimate affair for 15, or a blowout bash for 500 of your nearest and dearest, every detail deserves your utmost attention. There are plenty of would-be party planners (mothers, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, friends, sales clerks) with tips of their own to offer to make sure your wedding goes off without a hitch. But what if there is a hitch? Anyone who has been to a wedding knows weddings with hitches are still joyous and memorable...even if the cake melts, the band doesn't show and the groom is an hour late. After months spent deciding on a date with my groom, selecting the guest list and designing invitations, and choosing my dress, shoes, flowers and color themes, I feel I'm finally ready to start preparing emotionally for the real journey -- what awaits us after "I do." Oprah.com: What happily married women know . While I appreciate the generous wisdom of so many women who have gone before me as they educate me in the politics of table seating, the virtues of white versus ivory, the essentiality of at least one good Bach piece in the processional, and so on -- what I am most craving as I prepare for the impending end of my singledom is some good old-fashioned life advice. Perhaps I am impertinent. Because I have never had a problem asking difficult, embarrassing and perhaps completely inappropriate questions --don't mind me, blame the parents -- I've taken to asking every woman who will lend me her ear to share her secret to a healthy and happy marriage. I've selected my three favorite below, but I am most curious to hear from you if you have something to offer --maybe a bit of grandmother's advice passed down to you, or something you've recognized in your own relationships or marriages (even failed ones!), or something you wish someone had told you as you prepared to take that step. I'm all ears. Secret 1: Best marriages based on good health and bad memory . This perfect kernel came from a great-aunt of mine who lives abroad. Not that it needs much explanation, but I think the concept is worth delving into. So often, people would rather be right than happy. Think about all the petty arguments -- the ridiculous ones where you get so angry over nothing and forget what even sparked the fight -- that have ruined nights together or sent you to bed angry. How many of them were worth it? How long do you hold the grudge afterwards? Oprah.com: When you SHOULD hold a grudge . If the fight is only worth a short-lived outburst where you say things you don't mean, it probably doesn't need to happen. If it's the kind that is long, festering and sticks with you days and weeks later, then it probably needs a much more pervasive solution than a fight that simply points out the problems. I am all about airing grievances, but it has to be solution-oriented. Holding grudges, as tempting as it is, hurts you more than anyone else by bottling up the negative energy and embittering you from the inside out. On the flipside, recalibration and reconnection can happen in an instant. Keeping each other healthy -- like taking walks together, hearing each other out, supplying physical and emotional nourishment --brings you together to the exclusion of those things that can so easily drive people apart. Think about how much easier it is to feel less overworked and less stressed when you share a home-cooked meal, or even Chinese takeout, while sitting at a table with someone you love. Secret 2(a) --Adjust your expectation Secret 2(b) -- Choose your attitude . These two come from my mother and grandmother, respectively, and sum up their personalities in a nutshell. Both are firm believers in the idea that you can only control your own behavior. Trying to micromanage the universe -- or just other people -- is an exercise in futility and sure to irritate. When choosing your attitude, you're deciding what your outlook on life will be. It's easier said than done, but habitually happy people are not that way because only good things happen to them. Instead, they simply decide that no matter what happens outside their control, their attitude will be a positive one. Choosing to do the best you can with what you can control, and make the best of what you cannot control, seems like good life advice all around. Oprah.com: Elizabeth Gilbert explores marriage around the world . Adjusting your expectation has got to be the most overlooked trick in the book for securing a stable and happy relationship with friends and significant others. Mismatched expectations are so pervasively harmful because there's no way to get around them: I want something from you that you are not prepared to give either because you don't know it is what I want, or because it's not something that's in your nature to do. I get hurt repeatedly because, no matter how much I pout and sulk, you won't do what I want. It sounds childish when it's written like that, but this is exactly what the brain goes through when you expect five phone calls a day and he only has time for one. Or when he sends you lilies instead of the expected roses. Or when he likes rationalized argument and you prefer heated spats. Oprah.com:  5 best things to do for your relationship . The onus is on me to open the dialogue so that my expectations come to match yours. Moreover, I have to not try to change you (the theme here seems pretty obvious), because I have no real control over how you will change, if at all. A much safer bet would be to adjust what I expect, and to acknowledge that you are exactly the way you are meant to be. Caveat: For those of you thinking this sounds like the "roll over and play dead" strategy, it is not at all. Adjusting your expectations is not about sacrificing what you feel entitled to in order to feel happy and fulfilled. Instead, it is about giving up crazy and useless effort to change someone else in favor of realizing how you can create positive change by focusing on your own behavior. If you need more clarification on this point, go straight to the source. My mom's book on precisely this topic, and many others, is called "Us: Transforming Ourselves and the Relationships That Matter Most." Oprah.com: Top love myths --busted! Secret 3 --Never go to sleep angry . I cannot credit any one person with this tidbit because it seems to be the most commonly held tenet of happy couples everywhere. I don't know if there's a biological reason why going to sleep angry is bad -- other than it's actually difficult to fall asleep if one is in a rage about something -- but it always seems like I wake up with renewed resentment. It is as though my subconscious solidified all the petty ways I knew I just had to be right and so-and-so was obviously in the wrong. Even if you need to set an argument aside and approach it again in the morning with a clear head, reaching some stage of resolution the night before limits the amount of baggage that comes with the fight. If it lingers over long periods, chances are you're focusing more on getting a confession or proving someone wrong than you are on finding a solution. Oprah.com: How to know it's real love . And while you're at it, everyone knows to pick battles, but I've found it even more important to pick your timing. It may seem like an opportune moment to bring up a contentious subject as your partner is sinking into his or her pillow after a long day at the office, but in all likelihood, the response will not be a desired one. Cranky people are seldom rational, and sleepy people are seldom forgiving. Bear in mind that it won't always be sunshine and rainbows, and learning to forego the blowout fights as often as can be means less time cleaning up the mess and more time enjoying the party.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A 23-stone mother-of-one has lost more than half her body-weight after taking up bodybuilding – and is now training for a modelling competition. Amy Champion, 25, from Pontypridd, south Wales, once struggled to fit into size 20 clothes, and could not walk up stairs without getting out of breath. She piled on the pounds after falling pregnant with her daughter Annwyn, now two, using it as 'an excuse' to eat for two, scoffing on chocolate, biscuits and fizzy drinks. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Amy, left before her weight loss, and, right, training for a fitness competition . Amy said she piled on the pounds by 'eating for two' while pregnant with Annwyn (pictured) After joining a gym, Amy, who is a salon management student and is married to Sam, 26, discovered she had a knack for lifting weights and has now lost an incredible 12 stone, dropping to a size 8. Now the 5ft 10in weight-lifter, who was bullied and called a 'whale' because of her size, says she has never felt more confident about her body. Amy said: 'I'd always been big, and when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter, I started eating for two. The 25-year-old, who was a size 20, starting weight training and shed more than half her bodyweight . Amy is now a svelte size 8, pictured left and right after her weight loss, and has ditched unhealthy eating . 'I'd have a bacon sandwich for breakfast, followed by a sausage roll for lunch and then a massive pizza for tea. And throughout the day, I'd munch on chocolate, crisps and biscuits. 'Looking back, I can't believe how much I actually ate.' As Amy's weight soared to 23st, strangers began to stare and whisper and she also heard through friends that people referred to her as a 'whale'. She became self-conscious about her appearance and began to shun social events in favour of nights in front of the TV with her police officer husband. Amy, pictured on her honeymoon, weighing 20 stone and at a size 18 . Amy, who struggled to fit into a size 20 clothes, has lost 12 stone in weight after taking up bodybuilding . Amy, 25, pictured with husband Sam, left, at 20 stone, and, right, after dropping to a size 8 . The mother-of-one (centre) said she could barely walk up stairs without getting out of breath . BREAKFAST: Bacon sandwich . LUNCH: Sausage roll, can of Coke . TEA: Large takeaway pizza . SNACKS: Chocolate, biscuits, crisps . BREAKFAST: Porridge, fruit . LUNCH: Chicken salad . TEA: Chicken stir fry . SNACKS: Fruit . Amy said: 'I used my pregnancy as an excuse to avoid going out with my friends. The truth was that I was ashamed of myself. 'Even simple things like family barbeques were a nightmare, as I couldn't fit into the plastic chairs. 'Sam was always telling me how beautiful he thought I was, but it didn't make any difference. 'It was a vicious cycle. I hated the way I looked, but I just couldn't stop eating.' The turning point for Amy came in June 2012, when she gave birth to her daughter. Amy, pictured at 23 stone and a size 20 after giving birth to Annwyn, ditched biscuits for biceps . Amy, left, on holiday weighing 18 stone, and right, taking a selfie after dropping to a size 8 . Amy said: 'I'd been told by doctors that I'd never have children because of cysts on my ovaries. So when Annwyn was born, it was our own little miracle. 'She was absolutely perfect. As I held her in my arms, I promised myself that I would never let her grow up to be as ashamed of her body as I was of mine. 'I knew that after years of denying I had a problem, it was finally time to face my demons and build a happy, healthy future for me and my family.' Determined to set a good example, Amy joined a gym and threw out all of the junk food from her cupboards. Instead of scoffing on chocolate and takeaways, she began a healthy diet that included plenty of fruit and vegetables, and worked out with a personal trainer up to five times per week. Amy said she swapped her unhealthy diet for one that included more fruit and veg and started weightlifting . Amy, with Annwyn, left, at 20st and a size 18, and right, in training after losing half her bodyweight . She said: 'My first trip to the gym was absolutely mortifying. I had to walk slowly on the treadmill in case my flab jiggled, and by the end of the hour I was dripping in sweat. 'But I was proud that I had stuck to it, so I kept on going back. In time, I realised that I actually really enjoyed working out - especially lifting weights. 'I liked the challenge of pushing myself more each time, and every time I improved, I felt a sense of achievement. 'This really spurred me on to continue losing the weight.' Amy's dedication to the gym paid off, and over the next 18 months, she lost an incredible 12st - taking her down to a svelte 11st. Now a size 8, Amy is even training for a fitness modelling competition, where she will parade her bikini body in front of hundreds of people. Amy said: 'Two years ago, I could never have believed that I would be doing anything like this. I hated my body, and didn't want anyone to see it.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A British soldier was snatched and executed by the Taliban yesterday after he wandered off alone from a remote checkpoint in southern Afghanistan. It was the first kidnap of a British soldier in the conflict. His disappearance in an area riddled with insurgents and Improvised Explosive Devices sparked a 12-hour search with hundreds of troops and vehicles and all available helicopters. David Cameron was forced to abandon part of an unannounced visit to the country so personnel and equipment which would have been with him could be diverted to help. Talks: David Cameron and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai arrive for a joint press conference in Kabul this morning . Diplomacy: Mr Karzai gestures towards his British counterpart during the press conference. Mr Cameron is promising a surge in aid money to Afghanistan . Training: The PM meets Afghan National Army troops during a visit to their training camp at Camp Bastion, outside Lashkar Gah . The murder cast a shadow over what was supposed to be a victory tour for Mr Cameron to highlight progress in transforming Afghanistan and preparing for a withdrawal of British troops. The death of the British soldier showed the 'high price' being paid to stabilise the country, Mr Cameron said today. But he insisted the campaign against the Taliban in Helmand province was having 'success' and transition to Afghan security control was 'on track'. Speaking at a press conference alongside President Hamid Karzai in Kabul this morning, Mr Cameron said: 'This was very sad news and I want the thoughts and condolences of everyone on my team here to be with the family of that soldier who received this very sad news.' He added the incident was 'a reminder . of the high price that we have paid for the vital work we do in . Afghanistan and in Helmand province'. Last night the Ministry of Defence . confirmed that the soldier’s body was found inside a four-mile cordon . set up around the area he was last seen alive. It is understood he was shot in the . back of his head – which would indicate a cold-blooded execution – as . well as suffering other gunshot wounds.  Some of his equipment had been . stolen. An investigation is under way. The unnamed soldier was from the  4th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland and his family have been informed. He was last seen alive early yesterday after finishing duty at a vehicle checkpoint named  Salaang near a remote joint British and Afghan base in central Helmand province. Instead of returning to join  fellow members of 4 Scots he is said to have walked – armed and in full combat uniform – in the opposite direction. He was seen passing a checkpoint manned by the Afghan Army and said nothing as he walked into hostile territory. Taliban positions are often only a few hundred yards from those of Nato forces. Colleagues raised the alarm when he failed to return and a massive manhunt was launched involving British, U.S. and Afghan forces. Within hours, a Taliban spokesman claimed they had captured and killed the soldier after a fire fight but gave no further details. Security: David Cameron shakes hands with President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai at the presidential palace in Kabul this morning. He is expected to announce a 'modest' troop withdrawal later today . Conflict: Mr Cameron talks to Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, at Camp Bastion. The PM was forced to cancel part of his visit after a British soldier was captured an executed by the Taliban . Under guard: Flanked by soldiers and security staff, Mr Cameron undertook a walkabout at Camp Bastion . Military insiders scotched reports . from Afghanistan that the soldier had been ambushed or that there had . been a fire fight between insurgents and British troops. A . Whitehall source said: ‘He finished his shift on duty at a vehicle . checkpoint and then, for whatever reason, he has gone and walked off on . his own. ‘Rather than heading back to the base . with the other soldiers, he has gone off in the other direction. That . was the last time he was seen.’ Checkpoint Salaang is close to the . Nahr-e-Bughra canal. It is also near the much fought over village of . Kopak, in the south of the Nahr-e-Saraj district, which stands on the . Shamalan canal. Brigadier Ed Davis, the commander of Task Force Helmand – Britain’s mission in Afghanistan – recently described the area as ‘one of the most dangerous in Central Helmand’. Mr Cameron quickly decided to abandon the centrepiece of his visit – a trip to see British soldiers in the regional capital of Lashkar Gah – so personnel and vital helicopters could concentrate on the search for the soldier. Embarrassingly for the Prime Minister, the security alert came in an area which he was claiming as the leading success story in Helmand. Lashkar Gah is part of the first phase of the transition from international control to Afghan security control, and is supposed to be fully passed over next month. Under fire: A Taliban source said that they captured the soldier after a firefight, but this was quickly scotched by military insiders (file picture) In captivity: The only known Nato soldier held by the Taliban is U.S. Private Bowe Bergdahl, pictured a month after his capture in 2009 . The three other servicemen  who have . previously been kidnapped in Afghanistan were American. They were all . captured or killed by the Taliban. In June 2009, insurgents captured Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in the south-east of the country. They have released videos showing him in captivity dressed in Afghan clothing and military uniform. Sgt Bergdahl is seen denouncing the war in Afghanistan and calling for the U.S. to withdraw its troops from the country, in what the U.S. Military has called illegal propaganda. And in July 2010, two sailors from the U.S. Navy went missing in Logar province, south of the Afghan capital Kabul. Their dead bodies were found in the area days later. Only last week a British servicewoman described how Checkpoint Salaang had become embroiled in a firefight with insurgents. Able Seaman Heidi Telford  was with soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Rifles at the small checkpoint when they were ordered to provide cover for a patrol that came under attack. In total, 374 British servicemen and women have been killed since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001, including 26 this year. Defence chiefs have won a crunch battle over troop numbers in Afghanistan after David Cameron agreed to make only a ‘modest’ cut before the end of next year. On his visit to Afghanistan yesterday, the Prime Minister made clear that British frontline troops will be gone by the end of 2014. But he bowed to demands from generals not to reduce dramatically the 9,500 ground forces battling the Taliban before the end of next year’s summer fighting season. Battle: Mr Cameron, pictured alongside General Sir David Richards, second right, has chosen to make only a 'modest' cut to the numbers of troops in Afghanistan . Guard of honour: Mr Cameron walks past gathered American troops after his arrival at the base . When Mr Cameron makes a formal announcement to Parliament tomorrow he is expected to announce that no more than 500 troops will be pulled out before  autumn 2012. Yesterday he claimed Afghanistan was ‘entering a new phase’ where Afghan troops could shoulder more of the security burden. Mr Cameron said: ‘As that happens there will be opportunities to bring some British soldiers home. We’re talking relatively small numbers over a period of time.’ Britain’s most senior officer in Afghanistan, Lt-Gen James Bucknall, said recently that Nato troops need two more fighting seasons to suppress the Taliban. Most insurgents retreat during the cold winters. The Prime Minister confirmed he had bowed to the Army’s wishes. ‘You’ve got an enduring number of 9,500 this year and you’re not going to see a radical change for the fighting season of next year. ‘That’s not what this is about.’ Sharing a joke: The Prime Minister laughs with a group of soldiers who had gathered to meet him . Mr Cameron made clear that his deadline . of bringing combat troops home before 2015 is set in stone, regardless . of the situation on the ground. ‘I’ve always been clear. The end of 2014 . is a deadline. We won’t be here in large numbers or in a combat role,’ he said. ‘It is my judgment that it’s right for the British public to know, for the Afghan public to know and the Afghan and British military to know that there is an endpoint.’ Asked if the generals had won, a senior officer said last night: ‘We have. We have ended up in the right place.’ General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, who was travelling with Mr Cameron, said British and Afghan troops were on course to allow a withdrawal of all combat forces by the end of 2014. ‘I think we are on track,’ he said. ‘The trick isn’t that we have completely finished off the insurgents but by the time we transition out finally, the Afghan National Security Force can handle it.’</div></td></tr><tr>

Maybe our military could whip some of you into shape.' Meanwhile, protesters are facing off with authorities across the country as officers step up pressure against the demonstrators. In Portland, police in riot gear Sunday surrounded demonstrators in a downtown park area after hundreds of people defied the mayor's order to leave the park by midnight. By early afternoon, officers had mostly surrounded the camp where the protesters were holding a "general assembly" meeting to discuss their next moves following the eviction order. Some officers used nightsticks to push people away from the encampment and used loudspeakers to warn that anyone who resisted risked arrest and 'may also be subject to chemical agents and impact weapons.' Demonstrators chanted 'we are a peaceful protest.' Police could be seen carrying at least one protester away from the park. Another man was taken away on a stretcher; he was alert and talking to paramedics, and raised a peace sign to fellow protesters, who responded with cheers. There was no immediate word on arrests. Protester Mike Swain, 27, told The Associated Press: 'We were talking about what we were going to do and then they just started hitting people. Seems like a waste of resources to me.' Diss from a rose: An Occupy Portland protester offers police a flower after the deadline for them to vacate a park passed early this morning . Disobedience: In Portland, protesters and their supporters flooded a downtown city park area this morning in defiance of a midnight deadline to disperse was set by city officials . At one point the numbers swelled to thousands but then started to thin in the early morning hours. Protest organizers in Portland said they hope enough people will join them to make it difficult if not impossible for police to carry through on any eviction. 'Occupy the street,' one organizer said through a bull horn. 'Remain peaceful and aware. We have strength in holding the streets.' Mayor Sam Adams had ordered the camp shut down, citing unhealthy conditions and the encampment's attraction of drug users and thieves. Police numbers shifted throughout the night, but they showed no signs of moving against the protesters. Around 4 a.m. a line of about 200 police stretched across a street and in front of a federal courthouse. Protesters facing them appeared to be in a festive spirits with some banging on plastic pails, another clanging a cowbell while others danced in the streets as a man juggled nearby. Police had prepared for a possible clash, warning earlier that dozens of anarchists may be planning a confrontation with authorities. Crackdown: Police in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents . Officers seized pieces of cement blocks Friday, saying they were told some demonstrators had plans to use them as weapons against police. They've declared a war on corporate greed, but the Occupy Wall Street movement is costing small businesses big time. 'Occupied' coffee shops and . restaurants near Zuccotti Park are chasing away the regular clientele, . and the owners of the establishments are taking a nearly $500,000 hit. A survey conducted by the New York . Post showed that the businesses, which also include jewellery stores and . hair salons have collectively lost about $479,400 since the protest . began on September 17. one business owner told the paper: . 'We’re done with them! My customers used to take food to eat in the . park, but now they can't.' The staggering total does not even . include the money lost on toilet paper and supplies to clean and repair . bathrooms that used more than ever, thanks to protesters. As the movements shows no signs of slowing, business owners don't know where to turn. One proprietor told the paper that the regular customers - now scared away - are 'what keeps the lights on in this place.' Police spokesman Lt. Robert King told the AP: 'They said they believe some demonstrators are building shields and trying to collect gas masks. 'We'll take action that's appropriate, when it's appropriate.' 'We are not going to engage in confrontation for a misdemeanour,' he said, noting that is the legal violation for remaining in the park after midnight. It appeared earlier that about 200 campers planned to get arrested. But police action seemed less likely after the crowds swelled the parks in the early morning hours. In the hours leading up to midnight, protesters held general assembly meetings where they talked about what to do when the deadline came. The also repeated the main message of Occupy Wall Street movement of peaceful resistance to income inequality and what they see as corporate greed. As those speeches were going on, some snacked on coffee and burritos as others sang protest songs. About 60 bicycle riders circled the camp repeatedly to show support. 'We are a peaceful resistance,' said rider Chico Tallman, a 63-year-old accountant. 'But we're fed up with the direction the country is going. It's all about profit.' Face-off: Nineteen people were arrested in Salt Lake City after police protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment . In Philadelphia, a protester with a criminal past was quickly arrested after he allegedly raped a woman in her tent, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The 50-year-old suspect, who was not named, was booked after the 25-year-old victim called 911 to report the attack. In Salt Lake City, police arrested 19 people last night when protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment. The arrests came after police moved into the park early in the evening where protesters had been ordered to leave by the end of the day. About 150 people had been living in the camp there for weeks. Authorities in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents, said police spokesman Sonny Jackson. Mr Jackson said police had advised protesters since Wednesday that their tents in Civic Center Park and on a nearby sidewalk were illegal. Violence marked the protest in San Francisco yesterday where police said two demonstrators attacked two police officers in separate incidents during a march. Detained: Lionel Tiepanlev was one of 19 people taken into custody in Salt Lake City after protesters refused to leave the Occupy encampment in the city . Police spokesman Carlos Manfredi said a protester slashed an officer's hand with a pen knife while another protester shoved an officer, causing facial cuts. He said neither officer was seriously hurt, and the assailants couldn't be located. Meanwhile, in Southern California a small group of protesters braved soggy weather yesterday to gather for the first time under the banner of Occupy Inland Empire. Members of Occupy movements in Fontana, Redlands, Riverside, and other nearby towns marched past banks and in front of San Bernardino City Hall in what they called a 'visibility action,' The Sun newspaper reported. Last night, Occupy Portland protesters dismantled large sections of their encampment, but dozens of tents remained after midnight. For the second time in as many days, Oakland city officials warned protesters that they do not have the right to camp in the plaza in front of City Hall and face immediate arrest. The eviction notices come as officials across the country urged an end to similar gatherings in the wake of three deaths in different cities, including two by gunfire. Demands for Oakland protesters to pack up increased after a man was shot and killed Thursday near the encampment site. Restless: Police use their bikes to barricade Occupy Portland protesters as the city enforced a deadline to leave a city park . 'Your activities are injurious to health, obstruct the free use of property, interfering with the comfortable enjoyment of [Frank Ogawa Plaza], and unlawfully obstruct the free passage or use of a public park or square,' the notice read. Oakland officials first issued the eviction notice Friday after first pleading with protesters to leave the encampment. Police officials have said a preliminary investigation suggested the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups of men at or near the encampment. Investigators do not know if the men in the fight were associated with Occupy Oakland, but protesters said there was no connection between the shooting and the camp. The shooting occurred the same day a 35-year-old military veteran apparently committed suicide in a tent at a Burlington, Vermont, Occupy encampment. Police said a preliminary investigation showed the veteran fatally shot himself in the head. They said the death raised questions about whether the protest would be allowed to continue.

Alleged shooter: Teniecha Bright, 21, has also been charged with principal to attempted first-degree murder . On Thursday, a tearful Sheriff . Michael Tregre said the incident, which he described as an ambush, . started when a gunman opened fire on Jason Triche who was working an . off-duty traffic detail at a remote parking lot at the intersection of .

Tregre said . someone phoned into the deputies with a description of a car fleeing the scene, . and officers tracked it to the nearby Riverview trailer park.When . officers found the car, they handcuffed a suspect outside a trailer, . then knocked on its door. Tregre said someone with a dog answered. 'Another . person exited that trailer with an assault weapon and ambushed my two . officers,' Tregre said. There, St. John the Baptist Parish deputies Nielsen, a father-of-five, and father-of-one Jeremy Triche were killed. Edmonson said evidence and interviews so far place five of those arrested at the scene where Boyington was shot — the entrance of a parking lot used by contract workers on a job at a nearby oil refinery. All seven suspects, from LaPlace, 25 miles west of New Orleans, are being held in custody with bonds ranging from $350,000 to $750,000, although Brian Lyn Smith and Joekel are being treated for gunshot wounds in hospital.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">By . Jaya Narain and James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 20:07 EST, 28 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 29 June 2013 . Admittance: Child killer Ian Brady, murdered another four people . Letters emerged last night in which Ian Brady reveals the details of four more murders he claims to have committed. In the handwritten letters, the Moors Murderer said he killed two men in his hometown of Glasgow and a man and a woman in Manchester. He also claims the body of missing Keith Bennett is buried in Yorkshire, and not on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, where painstaking searches have taken place over many years. The previously unseen letters emerged as Brady was told he must remain in a mental hospital indefinitely after his request to return to prison was refused. A mental health tribunal yesterday concluded the child killer’s mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at Ashworth high-security hospital. Brady, who was convicted of the murders of five children aged between ten and 17, has made several claims over the years that he killed more victims. In 1987 he wrote to the BBC claiming he had killed five more people. Four of these he confessed to killing in the latest letters, which he had written to Brendan Pittaway, a former journalist he was in contact with while in Ashworth Hospital. Brady describes the four murders as ‘happenings’ and claims he killed a man on ‘waste ground behind the station’, a ‘woman’ in a ‘canal’, a man in Glasgow and another man ‘above Loch Long’, a picturesque sea loch at the mouth of the Clyde. He also gave details of the four alleged murders to Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, who led the search for Keith when Brady confessed to killing him in 1985. The claims were discussed in Mr Topping’s 1989 autobiography, in addition to an 18-year-old youth Brady claimed to have killed and buried on the moors. But the detective said he had serious doubts about whether Brady was telling the truth, and even the killer himself had suggested some of his claims might be ‘figments of his imagination’. According to Brady, Mr Topping told him a ‘mentally retarded man’ had confessed to the killing near the station but was never charged, and the woman found in the canal had been classed as a suicide despite ‘the absence of a suicide note and the presence of a bruise on her head’. Still locked up: A mental health tribunal yesterday concluded Ian Brady's mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at Ashworth high-security hospital . He alleges the detective told him records at Strathclyde Police did not go back as far as the death of one of the men in Glasgow and the second did not match any reports of missing persons. Brady also claims he gave Mr Topping ‘names, places and methods used’. He writes: ‘My statements were an embarrassment to the police, who, rather than admit irregularities had taken place, will move mountains to cover up.’ In the same letter, dated November 24, 1989, he writes: ‘As for Keith Bennett. The area of the site is in Yorkshire, not [double underlined] Lancashire, and should have been dealt with by the Yorkshire Police. ‘I have already stated my readiness to questioning under Sodium Penthatol [sic] so-called ‘truth drug’, but not [double underlined] by the Manchester Police.’ It is unclear if Brady's claim that . Keith's body is buried in 'Yorkshire, not Lancashire' is in reference to . his disagreement with boundary changes, and does not mean Greater . Manchester Police, who he has a grudge against, have been searching in . the wrong area. Last night it emerged the mental health tribunal process could be repeated almost immediately because Brady has the right to ask the authorities to review his detention every 12 months. Victim: Keith Bennett, 12, was snatched and murdered in 1964 . The tribunal was delayed from last year due to Brady’s ill health, meaning he could ask for another hearing later this year. Under the Mental Health Act, Brady also has the right to challenge yesterday’s decision, which would require a further hearing at an Upper Tribunal. The victims’ families last night branded the tribunal system ‘a farce’ and ‘circus’. Terry Kilbride, 59, whose brother John was killed aged 12 in 1963, said: ‘That he should be allowed to have another tribunal with the huge cost and heartache it has caused is a total farce. 'He uses the system as a plaything. It really does beggar belief.’ In the tribunal, estimated to have cost the taxpayer £250,000, Brady argued he merely suffered from a personality disorder which should not preclude him being returned to a normal prison. The 75-year-old painted himself as a victim, saying the conditions at the hospital in Merseyside were the ‘catalyst’ for his 13-year hunger strike – although the hearing was told he regularly enjoyed cups of soup and toast. He denied eating in secret and refused to say whether he would try to starve himself to death if he was transferred from hospital to a prison. Martin Bottomley, Head of Greater . Manchester Police's Cold Case Review Unit, said: 'In the 1980s, Brady . "confessed" to a number of other unrelated murders. 'All these claims were thoroughly investigated at that time and found to be completely unsubstantiated. 'A week hardly goes by when we do not receive some information which purports to lead us to Keith's burial site. 'All of these claims are investigated and it remains our aim to find Keith for the sake of his surviving family members. 'Only one person knows where Keith is buried and he refuses to disclose . that information, preferring to taunt Keith's loved ones, assisted by . those who seek to profit from his manipulative scheming.' He added that the police force has seen similar correspondence between . Brady and his confidantes and advisers, who 'have similar plans to . capitalise on his notoriety after his death'. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘We have no ongoing inquiries into Ian Brady.’</div></td></tr><tr>

The doctor said he had never seen anything like it. ‘We’ve been told it is very unusual, and people are always amazed when we tell them they are both twins. ‘After they popped out, Tim just shouted to me, 'we’ve got one of each', and I couldn’t believe it. Tyreece was so dark and Tyrelle was lily white. Tyrelle, left, was born 'lily white' while Tyreece, right, was born 'so dark', their parents say . They might look different - but their mother Mrs Charles said it's easy to tell the boys are brothers when they play together . The two boys have looked different since they were born and have spent their childhood being questioned over the way they look . Each year, around 12,000 sets of twins are born in Britain. Of these, 385 of them are black or mixed race. The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a woman is of mixed race, her eggs will usually contain a mixture of genes coding for both black and white skin. Similarly, . a man of mixed race will have a variety of different genes in his . sperm. When these eggs and sperm come together, they will create a baby . of mixed race. But, very occasionally, the egg or sperm might contain genes coding for one skin colour. If both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black. For a mixed-race couple, the odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one. But both scenarios can occur at the same time if the woman conceives non-identical twins - another 100 to one chance. This involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time, which also has odds of around 100 to one. If . a sperm containing all-white genes fuses with a similar egg, and a sperm . coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg, two babies of . dramatically different skin colours are born. ‘It’s when they play together that you can tell they are brothers.’ The . couple, who have been together since they were 12-years-old, have five . other children, Salina, 34, Tristan, 18, Shellee, 15, Julia, 13 and . Clareena, 11. Salina, Tristan and Clareena are almost black, whereas Shellee and Julia are pale white. The twins, their youngest children, were born six minutes apart in October 2005. Tyrelle was born first and weighed two pounds heavier than Tyreece. Now Tyreece is quite a bit bigger than Tyrelle and likes to take care of him. But while they watch out for one another, they enjoy doing different things, explained Tyrelle. He said: ‘I’m white, I’m like me mam. I like watching Doctor Who but Tyreece doesn’t like it, he likes playing football. I like tennis and he likes playing with his friends.’ Mr Charles, who is currently not working after suffering a stroke, said: ‘We were chuffed, shocked and so surprised when they came out. I was completely made up. ‘It was hard getting them back off the nurses.’ Mr Charles said the younger of the two was very protective of his brother. He said: 'Tyrelle has learning difficulties so Tyreece is very protective of him. ‘Tyreece has been bullied in the past for the colour of his skin, but we tell him to just walk away. ‘People have asked whether Tyrelle is my adopted son, they would say 'he can’t be yours'. 'It is when they hear him shout 'Dad' and then people just ask and they find it unbelievable. ‘I think it is better they are . different, they get on so well and they can’t be separated. They curl up . in bed together like they are still in their mother’s womb.’ 'One of each': The eight-year-old twins owe their unusual appearance to a combination of their parents' genes . Their parents Julia, pictured left, and Timothy Charles, pictured right, both 50, said the boys are both 'beautiful in their different ways' Each year, around 12,000 sets of twins are born in Britain. The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour - just like Tyrelle and Tyreece - are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a woman or man is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will usually contain possible genes coding for black and white skin which, if they come together, will create a baby . of mixed race. Happy families: 8-year-old twins Tyreece and Tyrelle Charles pictured with their parents Julia, left, and Timmy, right, and their sister Julia, 13, centre. The couple have seven children in total . But, on rare occasions, the egg or sperm might just have coding for one skin colour. If this is the case in both the egg and the sperm, the baby will be white, or all black - depending on what coding the egg or sperm had. The odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one for a mixed-race couple. But, if the woman conceives non-identical twins, both scenarios can occur at the same time. There is about another 100 to one chance of this happening. This involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time - which also has odds of around 100 to one. If a sperm containing all-white genes then fuses with a similar egg, while a sperm coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg, two babies of dramatically different skin colours will be born.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-11-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">By . Lizzie Edmonds . Amanda Spencer, 23, arrives at Sheffield Crown Court where she was found guilty of 16 child prostitution offences against five girls - some as young as 11 . Care staff knew about the crimes of a young woman who began grooming vulnerable underage girls at the age of 15 five years before she faced justice, reports today suggest. Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended girls, some as young as 11, on the streets of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, before luring them into a life of prostitution. Spencer would offer the vulnerable girls, many of whom were in care, a shoulder to cry on - before piling them with drink and drugs and forcing them to have sex with various men. She would then become aggressive if they refused to have intercourse with men in flats around Sheffield, in the city's Castle Markets and the toilets of nearby McDonald's and KFC restaurants, the court was told. Following a six-week trial, Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against five girls between 2006 and 2011. Today, it was claimed that care workers may have know about her crimes as early as June 2009 when a girl, then 14, allegedly told authorities she had been 'forced to have sex with an Asian male.' According to The Times, a confidential South Yorkshire Police report suggests staff at the teen's care home recorded she was 'very frightened of Amanda and had sex with male as Spencer said she would assault her if she did not' The newspaper suggests the 2010 report also details how the girl was forced to engage in sexual activity with Asian men for just Â£10. The girl was one of the five whose accounts of Spencer's abuse led to the 23-year-old's conviction earlier this week. Of the 14 charges she was found guilty of, four related to the 14-year-old. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'South Yorkshire Police take child exploitation cases extremely seriously as has been demonstrated by the 3-year-long investigation into Amanda Spencer and her associates. 'We are not able to comment further on this allegedly leaked report, especially as the case may still be the subject of a serious case review.' After 30 hours of juror deliberations, Spencer was cleared of a further three counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and was also cleared of three counts of causing or inciting child prostitution. Spencer was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation along with co-accused Kareem Ahmed, 30, . One of the men Spencer forced the girls to have sex with Ian Foster, 69, was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault on underage girls and one sexual assault on an adult. A confidential police report suggests care home staff were told about Spencer's crimes by a victim, then 14, as early as June 2009. The teen was one of the five girls whose accounts led to Spencer's conviction earlier this week . Lee Unwin, 27, was cleared of paying for the sexual service of a child. Bashdar Hamadamin, 26, was cleared of a charge of rape. John McLachlan, 65, who was accused of paying for the sexual services of a child, died midway through the trial. Jurors could not reach verdicts on 14 counts against Spencer and were discharged from their duties. Spencer and Foster are to be sentenced together on May 6. Following Spencer's conviction on Thursday, Judge Michael Murphy QC remanded Spencer in custody - telling her the crimes she had been convicted of were 'very serious'. Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against between 2006 and 2011 . He said: 'Expect an immediate and lengthy prison term.' Previously, Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, told the court Spencer would tell the girls to lie about their age and dress provocatively. She would then pocket the cash earned by the girls, seeing it as 'far more productive and profitable to co-ordinate a pool of prostitutes, than to work for drug money all by herself'. Miss Colborne said: 'Many of the victims in this case were in the care system or marked as "missing from home" at the relevant time, those still at home experiencing difficulties to varying degrees. 'All were lacking in self-esteem and the wherewithal or sense to protect themselves from exploitation.' She added: 'Amanda Spencer was a fraud, say the prosecution. She hung around the town centre identifying and befriending vulnerable children. 'She made them feel loved, she gave them a shoulder to cry on, a friend who purported to understand whatever sadness they were experiencing in their lives and in turn lured them into a life of abuse, which she exploited and profited from. 'She referred to them as her sisters or cousins when asked to account for who they were by people in authority. 'Although the children knew they were being sold for cash, their own drug and alcohol addiction sere so entrenched that they were incapable to extricate themselves. 'She told them how to dress more provocatively, to lie about their age and to close their minds to the reality of the sexual experiences, concentrating instead on the drugs. 'Those who had the temerity to refuse to do as they were instructed felt her wrath. She was violent and they were frightened of her.'

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 9:00 PM on 24th January 2012 . The wife of 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino has defended her husband in an Italian magazine interview, claiming: 'He is not a monster.' Fabiola Russo spoke out as calls increased for prosecutors to widen their probe into the Costa Concordia luxury liner disaster, in which 16 people have been confirmed dead and another 16 people still are missing. In an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, she said there was a witch-hunt against her husband - who is under investigation for multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a ship wreck. Witch-hunt: Fabiola Russo, wife of Costa Concordia captain Francesco . Schettino (right), claimed the media were blaming her husband for the cruise . liner disaster in an interview in Oggi magazine . Schettino is currently under house arrest following the disaster which happened earlier this month, after he recklessly steered his 114,000 ton ship, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, on to rocks close to the island of Giglio in a 'sail by' salute to impress a crew member. Mrs Russo, who lives with Schettino and their 17-year-old daughter in Meta di Sorrento near Naples, said: 'My husband is not a monster. He was always the go to guy for the crew. 'I am the wife of a seaman, so I am used to doing things on my own. I tackle situations and I resolve them. 'This is a witch hunt, everyone is out to get my husband. The media has made out he is to blame. 'He loves ships, he knows all about . them and has never stopped studying them, to learn what they are capable . of and what their limits are. 'He . didn't stop at just sailing ships. That's why for his crew he was . always the go to man, a maestro. He is decisive, stable and lucid, he . analyses situations, understands them and then acts. Death trap: Sea water flows into the Costa Concordia with rope and other debris strewn around inside this corridor . Recovery: Oil workers climb in board the cruise ship as salvage crews begin preparations to pump thousands of tonnes of fuel from the vessel . Stricken: Salvage workers start pumping from a pontoon near the ship, off the coast of Giglio, Tuscany . Upturned: Chairs lay strewn across this bar area in an internal shot from the Costa Concordia . 'At times Francesco seems arrogant because he puts himself above the people he is speaking to and often tells them to shut up. 'He . wasn't in charge of the Concordia by chance, he knows how to do his job . but sometimes even those who know how to do their job can make mistakes . - that's if he did make a mistake.' Extracts from the interview were also posted on Oggi's website along with a gallery of photographs provided by Fabiola, 48, among them a series of pictures showing her husband giving a safety demonstration when he was a captain with Renaissance cruise lines in 2000. Others showed him at a desk in his cabin on another ship, or where was sat on a lifeboat of a tanker while working for American petrol giants Sunoco. Amazingly she also revealed how they had once been fined for sailing too close to the shore in their sailing boat and added: 'What we really like is canoeing and to row together you need to be in harmony and my husband and I are.' It comes as Beniamino Deidda, prosecutor general of Tuscany, the Italian region Giglio is in, called for attention in the investigation to also focus on the Concordia's owners Costa Cruises. Damage: A massive rent is visible in the hull of the cruise ship as workers climb around it . Search: Italian Navy divers prepare to go into the vessel again to look for missing passengers . Investigation: Workers climb up a rope ladder on to the cruise ship. Divers found the body of the 16th victim earlier today . He said: 'For the time being the main . focus of attention is the captain, who it has been shown was tragically . inadequate but who chose him? 'The . lifeboats did not lower properly, the crew didn't know what to do, they . were unprepared in dealing with an emergency, wrong orders were given . such as being told to return to cabins. 'The . confusion that has emerged shows that there was an incredible lack of . attention to safety procedures. Safety should have been rehearsed . beforehand. 'You cannot blame all of this carelessness on the conduct of the captain. That's why this investigation cannot exclude others.' Today . the death toll rose to 16 as the body of a woman was found on deck . three of the Concordia after a hole had once again been blown into the . side of the ship. The victim was found with a life jacket and her body was taken to a mortuary on the mainland. The chaos in the bowels of the shipwrecked Costa Concordia is the worst Fabio Paoletti, a specialist cave diver, has ever seen. The 43-year-old has pulled more than a few decomposing bodies from shipwrecked trawlers over the years, but has never had to tackle anything close to the size of the vast 17-deck Concordia. He said: 'It is always scary, every time I go down to search the wreck, the unknown is frightening. 'Making our way through the debris is difficult and tiring. Visibility ranges from 30 inches to four inches, and we have to check everything - floating tablecloths, discarded clothes - for bodies.' 'Scary': Divers working in teams spend 50 minutes at a time searching the labyrinthine corridors of the Costa Concordia for survivors and victims . Divers work together in pairs for security reasons as they search the ship at a painstakingly slow pace, often having to squeeze into confined areas where the risk of becoming trapped is great. They swim through the corridors and rooms in a zig-zag movement to make sure they cover every area. Mr Paoletti said: 'We go down for 50 minutes at a time, with three oxygen tanks strapped to us, and leave one or two along the way in case we start to run out of air. 'If we're not back in that time, our back up races to find us. 'One of the biggest risks is that you get tangled up in electrical cables snaking in the water.' The Concordia, which boasted four swimming pools, a spa, five restaurants, 13 bars, and an array of entertainment and shopping facilities, lurched on to its side when it hit rocks off the Tuscan coast on Friday, January 13. So far, 16 people have been confirmed dead. Painstaking: A diver swims through a completely submerged part of the shipwreck. Teams of searchers have to zig-zag to make sure they cover entire rooms . While the search for survivors among the 16 still missing officially continues, Mr Paoletti said he was not hopeful they could still be alive. 'If there was by a slim chance anyone down there knocking or calling out for help, we would hear it, but it's unlikely,' he said. 'Sometimes we think we've found a body, but it can just be a bundle, a jacket and a pair of glasses.' The pairs use two head lamps to scour the freezing water and navigate an obstacle course of tables and chairs, as well as items left by terrified passengers as they rushed to evacuate. The ship had 4,229 people on board from more than 60 countries when it hit rocks. The bodies, wearing life-jackets, have largely been found at emergency meeting points.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-13-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Congressional Democrats are upping the pressure on President Barack Obama to fix what's ailing his signature health care initiative with some in the party warning they may be forced to back a House Republican proposal if the White House doesn't offer an alternative by week's end. "We've got to get out of the bunker and fix these problems," a senior congressional Democratic source told CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash of flaws in the newly rolled out law that have energized Republican efforts to weaken the President and his allies and derail a policy they have long considered unworkable. The White House has until Friday to devise a solution to the problem-plagued roll out of the Affordable Care Act, the source said. That's when House Republicans will take up a bill to address one of the more politically potent Obamacare problems for the President and Democrats -- those losing their health coverage due to the law despite Obama's assurances in selling it to the public that Americans could keep their plans if they wanted. The House bill would allow those insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the law by allowing anyone to purchase them, even though the existing policies don't meet the tougher requirements of the Obamacare initiative. Poll: Obama approval ratings drop, Americans say he's not trustworthy . Among other things, the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage. "In the absence of a solution that Democrats can support from the White House, you will see more and more Democrats voting for the Upton bill," the Democratic source said of the plan being advanced this week by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan. Fewer than 50,000 sign up on Obamacare website, media report suggests . Cancellations drive concern . Although the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website and expected low enrollment figures for the first five weeks of the program are embarrassments for the President and Democrats in Congress who rammed through the health law in 2010 without Republican support, it is the policy cancellations that are really driving Democrats to put more pressure the White House. Obama has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his Obamacare woes, according to the latest polling. His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust. Things could get even more heated on Wednesday when White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park will testify before a congressional committee investigating the rocky rollout of the HealthCare.gov website, the Obama administration said. Park had been subpoenaed to appear by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. Pressure to come up with a fix . Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, told reporters that Obama needs to come up with a solution "sooner rather than later." While New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the House GOP plan, saying he believes it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections. "We should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and doesn't make the problem worse." Israel told reporters Tuesday, saying it would be helpful if the White House came out with a proposal before Friday's House vote. He noted a White House official will meet with Democrats on Wednesday and played down the notion they are breaking with the administration on the issue. But Rep. John Larsen of Connecticut,  a loyal liberal and former House Democratic leader, said he hasn't seen details of the House GOP bill, but said he thought it could "make sense" and that there "could be support" depending on the approach. Hoyer said earlier he hadn't ruled out being open to Upton's bill, but his spokeswoman says he's now opposed since Upton has said he won't make changes and Democratic leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it. Boosting pressure further on Obama was former President Bill Clinton, who said on Tuesday that the President should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies. Clinton: Obama should 'honor commitment' on keeping health plans . "I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the President should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got," Clinton said during an interview with the website OZY.com. A Senate Democratic approach . A growing number of Democrats have called for changes or delays to the program as many face  tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents. Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves . Although he didn't go nearly as far as Clinton, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said he is open to changes as well and noted that Obama should have been more careful with his words in the first place. "A couple more sentences added would clarify it," the Senate's second-highest Democrat said on CNN's "Newsroom" with Ashleigh Banfield. "The president apologized. He said very clearly he was sorry if he misled people." Durbin added that Republicans and Democrats "need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better." Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats. She noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance, which she says makes up about 5% of the market, to keep their coverage. Insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met. "First of all, (Obama) apologized. And he's also apologized for the poor roll out.  And again, these things are real problems and they have to be fixed," Landrieu told CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. "But the promise of the Affordable Care Act, let me say again, is worth fighting for. And Republicans that continue to think that they're going to undermine it, repeal it, or defund it are wrong. They're on the wrong side of history," she said. White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Obama agreed with Clinton and is working to address the matter of people losing their coverage. He has already set in motion an aggressive effort to fix the website problems. Behind the scenes: Fixing the Obamacare website . Carney rejected the Upton bill as "not an effective fix" because it opens up the plans to anyone, not just the people who's plans are being canceled. "The President has instructed his team to look at a range of options" to find solutions for people who have lost their plans, Carney said. Enrollment woes . Democratic anger over the cancellation of insurance policies come as people wait for the release of enrollment numbers. What will Obamacare enrollment numbers tell us? The Obama administration is expected to release them by the end of  this week but has yet to say exactly when. White House officials are is lowering expectations, cautioning the numbers "will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated," Carney said. It is blaming a faulty federally run website that is hindering the ability of consumers to sign up for coverage. "We are working 24-7 to ensure that the site is working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November," said Chris Jennings, deputy assistant to the President for health policy. Young coders build health-care website in days . Consumers have until December 15 to submit payment for coverage that begins January 1. The overall sign-up deadline for 2014 is next March 31.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">EXCLUSIVE . By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 11 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:30 EST, 12 August 2013 . Meetings: The summits have often been with politicians representing Prince Charles's pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change and town planning . The full extent of Prince Charles’s influence over public life emerged last night. Since the election he has held 36 private meetings with Cabinet ministers – one a month. The summits have often been with politicians representing his pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change, health and town planning. But critics accused him of an ‘incontinence of lobbying’. Including junior ministers, Charles has enjoyed a total of 53 private audiences since May 2010. He has met David Cameron seven times and Labour leader Ed Miliband three times. But he has only met Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, once. Last night a Clarence House spokesman insisted the Prince of Wales ‘has a right’ to ‘communicate privately’ with the government. Ministers have long complained about being bombarded with so-called ‘black-spider’ handwritten memos from Charles, in which he has expounded his view on a variety of issues. In 2005, a memo was disclosed at an employment tribunal in which Charles blamed the education system for making people ‘think they can all be pop stars’. The Prince is known for his strident views on a range of public policy areas. He has spoken out on green issues and rural affairs, and is vocal in his support for alternative medicines such as homeopathy. He also speaks out on town planning – he has sponsored a new model development in Poundbury, Dorset – and against modern architecture. In line with his interest in green issues, he has met ministers from the Department for Energy and Climate Change seven times, including secretaries of state Chris Huhne and Ed Davey. He met junior minister Greg Barker no . fewer than four times. Ministers from the Department for Environment, . Food and Rural Affairs have been called in five times. Discussions: Charles has met David Cameron (left) seven times and recently spoke to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) about the regulation of herbal medicines . Talks: Charles has met almost all the Cabinet, including Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) twice and Home Secretary Theresa May (right) once . On health, Charles recently met Jeremy Hunt to discuss the regulation of herbal medicines and funding for alternative medicines. He has also met four ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government, which has responsibility for town planning and architecture. While he has met almost all the Cabinet, he has shown much less of an interest in those heading up other important departments. He has met Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne just once each, and has never met a justice minister. Details of the full extent of his meetings comes after controversy over the High Court’s continuing refusal to allow the publication of letters that he has written to a range of government departments. Dialogue: Charles met with former defence secretary Liam Fox (left) once and former environment secretary Caroline Spelman (right) twice . Last night Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘It is not the Prince of Wales’s duty to have private meetings with ministers and be involved in the political decisions of this country. The main qualification of the job of head of state – which he will eventually be – is to be above the maelstrom of politics. 'The main qualification of the job of head of state - which he will eventually be - is to be above the maelstrom of politics' Paul Flynn, Labour MP . ‘This is an incontinence of lobbying from Prince Charles. There is a move towards transparency in lobbying in general, but this should include royal lobbying from one of the most powerful and influential men in the country. ‘Imagine what will happen when he is monarch. If there is a bill he disagrees with, will he lobby against it? If he carries on like this when he is king, it will provoke a constitutional crisis.’ Mr Flynn called for minutes of the meetings to be publicly available. ‘There is absolutely no reason for all this secrecy,’ he said. Financial matters: Charles has met both Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (right) just once . Summits: He has met Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) once in 2011, and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) twice, in 2010 and last October . The issue of Charles’s opinions is becoming more and more relevant because he has recently started to take on more official duties from his 87-year-old mother. He will, for example, take the place of the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka in November. 'The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses' Clarence House spokesman . It is understood the majority of the meetings were requested by the Prince rather than the ministers concerned. Minutes are not publicly available, with both sides refusing to disclose what is discussed. The bare facts of the meetings are published on the Court Circular. A spokesman for Clarence House said: ‘Official meetings, sometimes instigated by ministers, are important to the Prince in his role as heir to the throne and ministers from successive governments have found that he brings important insights, perspectives and knowledge built over 40 years of experience in a range of areas aimed at transforming lives and building sustainable communities.’ She added: ‘The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses, to bring his unique perspective and reflect the many issues people raise with him personally on his extensive engagements around the country.’</div></td></tr><tr>

To repay Mr Comfort for his expertise, Pitt accompanied the war hero to the London Film Festival gala screening of the film on Sunday night, where they walked the red carpet together. Pitt laughed and joked with Mr Comfort as they posed for pictures at the Battersea Evolution, alongside his co-stars including Shia LaBeouf. Scroll down for video . Hero: Brad Pitt was accompanied to the London Film Festival première of his new movie Fury by World War II veteran Peter Comfort on Sunday night . The veteran has previously admitted he was forced to look Pitt up online because he had no idea who the Hollywood star was. War veteran Peter Comfort visits Brad Pitt on the set of Fury where he was questioned about his role in the conflict by Pitt and the cast and crew . Grateful: To repay Mr Comfort for his expertise, Pitt  accompanied the war hero to the London Film Festival gala screening of the film on Sunday night . Both men were dapper in their tuxedos as they took to the red carpet for the première . Pitt had invited Mr Comfort to the set of the new blockbuster in Hertfordshire to hear a first-hand account of life inside an amphibious Sherman tank. Mr Comfort went to meet him and left the film crew laughing when he admitted he had to check out who Pitt was on the internet first. He said: ‘Mr Pitt was very friendly and charming actually but I didn't know who he was.

I am a fan of actors like Alec Guinness, but of course he is dead now.’ Making time for the fans: Pitt posed for selfies on the red carpet with eager fans . Expertise: Pitt asked Mr Comfort for advice when he was making the film in the UK last year . Happily married: Pitt's wedding ring was clearly visible as the father-of-six posed for pictures with fans . Mr Comfort, one of the last Second World War survivors of the 13/18th Royal Hussars, was assigned to the Sherman tanks at just 21-years-old. He landed at Sword beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944 with the tanks going into the water 500 yards from the shore, something the Germans had not seen before. By the end of that day 140 of his colleagues were killed and 350 more were wounded. Enthusiastic: Eager fans couldn't get enough of Pitt as he did the rounds on the red carpet before the screening . Putting pen to paper: The actor signed photos for his eager fans who had camped out to see him . All is forgiven: Pitt didn't take it personally that Mr Comfort had no idea who they were when he first contacted him . Motley crew: Director David Ayer, actors Pitt, Anamaria Marince, Alicia Von Rittberg, wearing  AW14 Burberry Prorsum, Michael Pena, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, Shia Le Beouf and producer John Lesher posed for photographers at the première . In the new wartime thriller, Pitt plays the commander of a DD Sherman tank. Mr Comfort, from Ripple, near Dover, Kent, said: ‘My regiment, the Light Dragoons, got in contact with me about three weeks ago. 'They'd been approached by an ex-officer who worked for a film company and asked if there were any old boys left. Happier than ever: Shia LaBeouf attended the première with his actress girlfriend Mia Goth . Wow thing: The pretty lady wowed in a lace dress and statement heels as she walked the red carpet . Bromance: Shia also appeared to have eyes for his co-star Michael Pena . Looking sharp: Logan Lerman went for a black tuxedo for his big night . Pottering around: Jason Isaacs plays US Army Captain Waggoner in the film . Thumbs up! Actor Jon Bernthal poses for photographers upon arrival at the premiere . Date night: Guy Ritchie and wife Jackie Ainsley showed up to support Pitt . ‘Then Brad Pitt phoned me and said he wanted to speak about Sherman tanks for a film. ‘He talked me into going and, I have to say, I was extremely well treated. ‘They wanted a lot of information to make it accurate and fired a lot of questions at me. ‘Luckily there weren't any questions I didn't know the answer to. ‘The film crew got me up on the tank for a few pictures and wanted to know everything about it. Taking the plunge: Alicia von Rittberg was stunning in a plunging Grecian gown at the film première . Father/daughter outing: Terry Gilliam and his daughter Amy Gilliam also attended the party . ‘They wanted to know where we slept, where we spent a penny, the living conditions and what it was like in action, so I told them. ‘I don't like to talk about it because I saw too many people killed but Mr Pitt was very nice and I will be interested to see the film.’ Recalling his experiences in Normandy, Mr Comfort said: ‘I don’t like to talk about it because I saw too many people killed. But Mr Pitt was very nice and I will be interested to see the film.’ Doing his thing: The actor took to the stage inside the venue with the rest of his co-stars . Speaking out: Brad took to the microphone as he addressed his delighted fans who had come to see the movie . Hey there! Brad cut a smart figure as he left the venue later that evening . The M4 Sherman was the primary battle tank used by the US in the Second World War. Thousands were used by Britain, replacing its own unreliable and obsolete designs. The Duplex Drive variant – nicknamed ‘Donald Duck tanks’ – could enter the water 500 yards from the shore. LaBeouf said Brad Pitt was known as 'Top Dog' on set and everyone was 'vying for his attention'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Pregnant actress Jaime King has revealed that it was her close friend, and fellow TV star, Lena Dunham who gave her the courage to speak out about her awful struggle to conceive her first child. Speaking to Daily Mail Online about the upcoming release of her new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII, in which she showcases her impressive vocal talents alongside those of Oscar-nominated composer J. Ralph, the 35-year-old explained that it was only after reading about Lena's own struggles with endometriosis in her book Not That Kind of Girl, that she felt able to open up about her own fertility issues. 'Lena Dunham was a big factor in my speaking out,' she said. Making moves: Jaime King, 35, lends her vocals to a breathtaking new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII's latest campaign . Expecting: Jaime announced earlier this month that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, after revealing last year that she had suffered five miscarriages before conceiving her son James . 'As a dear friend who spoke out in her book about endometriosis, she helped give me the courage to ponder what kind of impact I wanted to make on this world. And I thought, "Hey, you have a big platform to help other women and couples." 'I know it's not a sexy topic, I know that it's extremely private and vulnerable, but at the same time I went through years of silent suffering because no one speaks about these things or the symptoms and effects of endometriosis.' Jaime, who earlier this month revealed that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, added that she hopes her decision to speak out about her fertility struggles will help her fans to see past the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life'. People think I live a picture perfect life, and it started to upset me that I could possibly, in some way be presenting a curated, false idea of what my life is to my fans and to the world,' she said. 'Because that's false, it's a lie. In Hollywood we put out this totally unrealistic idea of a glamorous life because that's a part of the illusion that the public and system wants to see. A way to escape. 'However, why can we not do both? Be beautiful and inspiring yet be honest and support others on their journeys. If one more person can feel supported - then I will sacrifice any level of vanity and privacy for that. 'I will sacrifice anything to help educate and bring awareness to something so common, yet so oddly taboo. Because it shouldn't be. It's not about infertility per se - it's about the disease of PCOS and endometriosis and the prevention and care of that.' When it comes to setting an example for other mothers-to-be, Jaime, who is currently starring as restaurant owner Lemon Breeland in hit CW series Hart of Dixie alongside former OC star Rachel Bilson, could not be a better role model. While already balancing her TV role with her family life at home with her beloved husband and son, who is now 16 months old, the actress is also busy throwing her heart and soul into her music career - and confessed that she has no plans to slow down any time soon. Lean on me: Expectant mother Jaime revealed that she was given the courage to speak out about her own struggles with PCOS after reading about her friend Lena Dunham's own diagnosis in her book . Natural talent: Jaime explained that she has no plans to slow down on the work front, despite her pregnancy, noting that 'working always makes a pregnant woman happy' 'Working always makes a pregnant woman happy,' she said. 'Well, at least an insanely creative woman such as myself.' Thankfully, Jaime has plenty of creative projects to keep her occupied. As well as appearing in the soon-to-be launched video campaign for Grace MMXIII, the little black dress brand founded by Jens Grede and Erik Torstensson of Frame Denim, Jaime is also working on her own album with her Grace MMXIII video collaborator J. Ralph, which, she teased, will be available soon. But music is in no way a new focus for Jaime, who revealed that she has been 'working on music and writing poetry and songs for friends' for as long as she can remember. She has also worked on her fair share of music videos in the past, both in front of and behind the cameras. In 2012, Jaime starred in the video for Lana Del Ray's hit single Summertime Sadness, which was directed by her husband Kyle, with whom she has also co-directed a number of music videos in the past. But when it came to pursuing a singing career in her own right, under her own name, Jaime credits her close friend - and global singing sensation - Taylor Swift with giving her the inspiration that she needed to 'put her work out there'. 'Taylor was really the biggest catalyst for me to put my work out there, she lit a fire under me when she read my writing and her brilliance is unparalleled,' she said. 'She is fearless and incredibly brave, always authentic yet capable of reaching people on such a universal scale - it's very powerful.' And while she is finally ready to put her own music out there in the spotlight, Jaime explained that she still plans to remain a strong support to her friends, whom she describes as being 'the greats in their industry'. Number one fan: Jaime describes herself as a 'cheerleader' for her friends, such as Lena (L) and singer Taylor Swift (R), who she believes are 'greats' in their industries . Family ties: Jaime hopes that her struggles with PCOS will help her fans to see beyond the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life' and help them to find the strength to overcome their own issues . Surprise! The Hart of Dixie star announced her pregnancy with this adorable Instagram snap of her son James, who is now 16 months old . Reaching out: Jaime posted a heartfelt message to her fans on Twitter, thanking them for their continued support . 'I have an interesting dynamic with my friends because many of them are the greats in their industry,' she said. 'I have always been there to support their artistry because music has the capacity to reach people globally and truly change the planet by connecting us through song. I find by supporting someone like Taylor, or any friend who has that reach, is very important because I am deeply passionate about artists that have a voice and use it to change things for the better. 'I love being a cheerleader behind-the-scenes because in my industry I'm always front and center.' In her new music video for Grace MMXIII, however, the expectant mother happily takes center stage, showcasing her beautifully raw singing voice, as well as a number of seductive dance moves, in the dynamic and visually breathtaking clip. 'The only nerve-wracking part [about the video] is that my vocals are a live track with no auto tune, no bells and whistles, purely my voice which is the same with J. Ralph,' she said of the filming process. 'He is a visionary artist and carefully selected very rare and beautiful microphones that would naturally lend themselves to our particular style. 'For me, to sing and write, to have a band with J. Ralph is just another form of my expression as an artist. What we make musically is very poetic and dramatic which is how I've always sang - more like an old school jazz singer, not a popstar. 'I really just love every medium of art. And I want people to love it of course, to move them deeply. As a performer my goal is to always make people feel less alone in the world. To feel connected. 'But I will leave it to my friends to dominate the music industry.'</div></td></tr><tr>

Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel put their differences over the U.S.'s spying program aside on Friday and threatened tougher and . broader new sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't . quickly change its disruptive behavior in Ukraine. 'We . will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more-severe . sanctions' if Russia disrupts a presidential election in Ukraine . scheduled for May 25, Obama said at a news conference with Merkel . outside the White House early Friday afternoon. 'Further sanctions will be unavoidable,' Merkel agreed. Scroll down for video . Agree to disagree: President Barack Obama (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) put their differences of opinion over the U.S. spying program aside on Friday to display trans-Atlantic unity against an assertive Russia . This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade. In October, Obama promised that the U.S. was no longer hacking her personal calls. That courtesy does not apply to other residents of Germany, including other German officials, however. The issue has aggravated German citizens, prompting . calls for Berlin to strike some type of agreement with Washington to . limit U.S. surveillance on German soil. Germany had hoped to get the U.S. to enter into a no-spy agreement with the country before today's meeting, but talks fell apart, The New York Times reports. 'What the Germans want, and wanted, is that we would never do anything . against their laws on their territory,' a senior administration official told the Times. That's an agreement the U.S. 'has with no country.' 'There’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' President Obama said in February at a press conference with French President Francois Hollande when the subject of spying on that country's citizens came up. President Obama said on Friday it . wasn't accurate to say that the United States had proposed and . then withdrawn a no-spy agreement. Instead, he said the government has . proposed the same guidelines with Germany that it maintains with other . allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail. At a press conference the two leaders made it clear . they have differences when it comes to U.S. surveillance overseas. 'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,'  President Obama said. Merkel was diplomatic, as well, but a shade more blunt: 'We have differences of opinion to overcome.' A German parliamentary panel probing the NSA issue . is eager to invite former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to speak to the . panel. The German government has made clear it opposes the idea of . letting Snowden, whose U.S. passport has been revoked, testify in . Berlin, drawing criticism from Snowden's opponents. This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade . The two leaders met as the European Union announced it would hold talks with Ukraine and Russia later this month on the price of natural gas, an attempt to avoid any disruption in supplies. Moscow recently hiked the price of gas shipped to Ukraine to $485 per thousand cubic meters from $268.50, and threatened to limit deliveries if Kiev does not meet the new price and repay a debt of $3.5 billion. More forebodingly, pro-Russia forces shot down two Ukrainian helicopters Friday and Ukraine reported many rebels dead and wounded as the interim government in Kiev launched its first major offensive against an insurgency that has seized government buildings across the east. The diplomatic deal struck two weeks ago . in Geneva has failed to de-escalate the conflict between pro-Russian . separatists in eastern Ukraine and the central government in Kiev. The . U.S. and Europe have sharply rebuked Putin for flouting his . responsibilities under the deal, and Moscow on Friday declared all hopes . for implementing the accord 'effectively destroyed' after Kiev's offensive against the insurgents. Obama said Putin is free to offer his own . views with regard to events in Ukraine, but it isn't acceptable for the . Kremlin to think 'it has veto power' over decisions made by a duly . elected government in Kiev. In their remarks, Obama and Merkel both said they would prefer the situation in Ukraine to be settled through diplomacy, but both leaders made it clear that . the next step would be to order sanctions on separate parts of the . Russian economy or military — on energy or arms for example — if Russia continued to ignore the agreement it made earlier this month with the U.S. and EU. Neither leader specified precisely what was being considered. As the crisis in Ukraine has worsened, Merkel has spoken to Putin perhaps more frequently than has any other European leader. Because of this, the U.S. sees her as a critical channel of communication, as well as a key player in the effort to prevent other EU nations from going soft on sanctions. 'There's no question that the situation in Ukraine, the continued failure by Russia to abide by its commitments in the Geneva Agreement will be a focus of the conversation,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said before the two leaders met. U.S. and German officials said ahead of the Obama-Merkel meeting that part of the discussion probably would focus on how the U.S. and Europe would coordinate harsher punishments — including sanctions targeting broad sectors of Russia's economy — should Moscow further provoke tensions in Ukraine, such as by sending military forces into restive eastern Ukraine. The White House is concerned that Europe's deep economic interests in Russia and dependence on Russian energy could deter EU nations from following through with sanctions that could ricochet onto their own economies. 'She's getting enormous pressure from German industry not to harm their interests,' said Heather Conley, a Europe expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "She has to start laying the political groundwork for this because it requires some sacrifice." Merkel, like Obama, has ruled out military action to deter Putin from seizing more of Ukraine. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has urged Obama to send weapons to Ukraine's government, said he planned to tell Merkel during a private meeting that he was embarrassed but unsurprised by her country's failure of leadership. 'The leaders, they're being governed by the industrial complex of Germany,' McCain said Thursday. 'They might as well have them in the government. It's shameful.' A troubled EU-U.S. trade agreement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, was also on the agenda, as well as joint efforts to deal with climate change, Syria's civil war and nuclear negotiations with Iran, said Laura Magnuson of the White House's National Security Council. Merkel will also speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday, focusing on the fledgling trade agreement and U.S.-European economic ties. President Obama says the U.S. government has proposed the same spying guidelines to Germany that it maintains with other allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail . 'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,' President Obama said on Friday of the U.S. and Germany's positions on the U.S.'s spying program. Merkel was a shade more blunt: 'We have differences of opinion to overcome' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League, Football League and FA Cup fixtures. 1. Arsenal’s performance at Stoke was so bad that they ended up trying to play The Potters at what used to be their own game of lumping long balls. Aaron Ramsey dropped deeper and deeper trying to aim for Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud, attempting eight long passes in the second half – more than any other Arsenal outfield player. The Gunners also attempted more crosses than Stoke – 27 against the home side's 23. Arsenal players look dejected after conceding a third goal against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday . 2. If banging in crosses is part of a new Arsenal philosophy they will be grateful to West Ham for the way Carl Jenkinson has been converted into an attacking full back during his loan at Upton Park. The 22-year-old, who earned one England cap as a sub in a friendly against Sweden in 2012, fired in 10 crosses, including the one from which Andy Carroll scored the first of his two goals in the 3-1 win over Swansea. He’s attempted 57 crosses in 12 games as a Hammer this season, an average of 4.75 per match. In his 14 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last year his average was 2.4. West Ham's Carl Jenkinson controls the ball against Swansea at Upton Park . 3. Aston Villa have stumbled on a central defensive pairing to take them forward if they can’t keep Ron Vlaar away from the clutches of Manchester United in January. In four games since Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore were flung together to solve an injury crisis, Villa have now conceded just three times. Against Leicester they made 27 clearances between them, with Denmark centre half Okore winning 100 per cent of his tackles. Aston Villa's Ciaran Clark (left) celebrates with Jores Okore after scoring the equaliser against Leicester . 4. Steven Taylor will be suspended from Newcastle’s trip to Arsenal next weekend but should be the first name on Alan Pardew’s teamsheet when Sunderland arrive at St James’ Park for the North East derby on December 21. The 28-year-old Geordie has started only six games this season after falling out of favour with Pardew – but ending Chelsea’s unbeaten record means the Toon have won every single one of them. Steven Taylor (left) is sent off by referee Martin Atkinson (centre) at St James' Park on Saturday . 5. Aaron Lennon might be keen to point out a similar statistic to Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after being dumped back on the bench until the final seven minutes against Palace. The winger doesn’t appear to fit his manager’s system – but when he does play Tottenham get results. The 3-0 defeat at Chelsea, when he was hauled off after 58 minutes, was the first time he had been on the losing side of a game he started all season. Tottenham’s record in his other seven starts reads won six, drawn one. Tottenham Hotspur's Aaron Lennon comes on for the final seven minutes against Crystal Palace . 6. Roberto Martinez claimed Eliaquim Mangala should have got a red card for catching Samuel Eto’o with a kung-fu style kick. Whatever the rights and wrongs of referee Andre Marriner’s decision there’s no doubt that Mangala has still got problems finding the correct composure to bring his physical style of play in tune with the Premier League. The £32m France defender has now picked up four yellow cards and one red in his nine domestic games since signing for City from Porto in the summer. Eliaqium Mangala (centre left) challenges Samuel Eto'o (centre) for the ball in the air at the Etihad on Saturday . 7. QPR centre half Richard Dunne might not be the quickest but he makes up for it with speed of thought and determination to defend. In the victory over Burnley he made 20 clearances – more than anyone else – and won 100 per cent of his tackles. Since the 35-year-old got back into the team Rangers have won 10 points from eight games. QPR centre half Richard Dunne makes a clearance during the match against Burnley on Saturday . 8. Derby’s promotion efforts are benefiting from a bit of father-and-son work between boss Steve McClaren and his son Joe. McClaren Jnr is in charge of Under 21 recruitment at Pride Park, and was the man responsible for targeting Real Madrid youngster Omar Mascarell to sign on a season-long loan. The Tenerife-born defensive midfielder has taken time to settle in England, but was excellent in the 3-0 win over Brighton that kept the Rams at the top of the Championship. Joe had been tracking the progress of 21-year-old Mascarell since he spotted him while working in analysis for his dad’s old club Twente. Derby County manager Steve McClaren (right) shakes hands with Brighton manager Sami Hyypia . 9. Wolves chairman Steve Morgan once fell out with his manager of the time Mick McCarthy by going into the dressing room to give his players a rollicking after a 3-0 home defeat by Liverpool. The 62-year-old house building multi-millionaire clearly didn’t learn any lessons about letting his passions boil over. He will be in hot water with the FA after confronting referee Mike Jones on the pitch at the end of his club’s 2-1 defeat by Bournemouth. Jones, demoted from the Premier League list for booking Sergio Aguero instead of giving him a penalty, had sent off Wolves stars Rajiv van La Parra and Matt Doherty. Wolves chairman Steve Morgan (right) confronts referee Mike Jones after the final whistle on Saturday . 10. One of the sores that never healed between MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon was over which club was entitled to wallow in the FA Cup history of the Crazy Gang’s 1988 triumph over Liverpool. Fitting, then, that in the week that the controversial documentary remembering that epic achievement had its premiere the club the fans launched after seeing their own hijacked should manage its own Cup milestone. A 1-0 win at Wycombe thanks to Sean Rigg’s goal put AFC into the third round for the first time since the club was formed 12 years ago. Meanwhile, the MK version went out losing 1-0 at home to Chesterfield. Sean Rigg (left) celebrates after scoring the winner for AFC Wimbledon against Wycombe in the FA Cup .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-19-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- For more than two decades, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was a practicing Pentecostal. She belonged to the Wasilla Assembly of God church in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. But though she attended the church from her teenage years to 2002, the Alaska governor hasn't talked much about her religion since joining the Republican ticket. Palin's former pastor, Tim McGraw, says that like many Pentecostal churches, some members speak in tongues, although he says he's never seen Palin do so. Church member Caroline Spangler told CNN, "When the spirit comes on you, you utter things that nobody else can understand ... only God can understand what is coming out of our mouths." Some Pentecostals from Assembly of God also believe in "faith healing" and the "end times" -- a violent upheaval that they believe will deliver Jesus Christ's second coming. "Our basic belief is that God is God and he knows where history is going and he has a purposeful plan and within the middle of that plan we live in an environment in our world where certain events would take place," says McGraw. "Sarah wasn't taught to look for one particular sign -- a cataclysmic sign. She knew as every Christian does ... that God is sovereign and he is in control." The McCain campaign says the governor doesn't consider herself Pentecostal.  Watch Palin's father talk about her religious upbringing » . McGraw says Palin's Pentecostal roots may be being downplayed for a reason: "I think there may be issues of belief that could be misunderstood or played upon by people that don't know." When asked by CNN about Palin's beliefs, campaign spokeswoman Meghan Stapleton would only say the Republican vice presidential candidate has "deep religious convictions."  Watch how Palin's religious roots formed » . But how might her religious beliefs impact policy in Washington if the Republican ticket is successful? Palin's former pastor says he has no doubt her religious beliefs will influence her decision making when it comes to government policy. Regarding her desire to build an Alaskan pipeline and explore for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, McGraw told CNN, "Sarah knows that in Genesis, God creates the world and it's very good and that we're supposed to be caretakers in terms of not destroying the environment, so there's no way that Sarah is going to exploit or damage the Alaska tundra in the name of getting gas if she doesn't have to." Palin's neighbors react to her swift rise . Six years ago, Palin left Assembly of God to join the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church. But the Assembly of God says she still returns for special conferences and events, such as the graduation of ministry students in June. Video of a speech she gave at the church just two months before joining the Republican ticket is making the rounds on the Internet. Speaking of the troops in Iraq, Palin says on the video, "Pray for our military men and women who are striving do to what is right. Also for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for -- that there is a plan, and that plan is God's plan."  Watch Palin speak at her former church » . Her campaign says she doesn't mix her faith with government business. But Palin did ask her audience to pray for a $30 billion natural gas pipeline she is on a mission to build in Alaska. In the video Palin says, "I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas pipeline built. So pray for that ... I can do my job there in developing my natural resources. But all of that doesn't do any good if the people of Alaska's heart is not good with God." McGraw, who was her pastor until 1998 and while she was mayor of Wasilla, says that Palin attended discipleship classes to strengthen her Pentecostal faith and that he counseled her on how to become a better leader. "Everyone has a way of viewing the world and Sarah does too and hers would be shaped by the common-sense practicality of how she's been shaped by the Bible -- which is basically the world view that says God loves people, people can access him and he's given us wisdom for living," McGraw says. He says Alaska has seen Palin's faith play out. As governor she passed ethics reform and took on what she's referred to as a "good-ol'-boys network." However, she has said she would not seek to impose her religious views on others. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Sarah Palin . "I think one of the most obvious ways it plays out is what you've seen -- is being courageous enough to deal with deception and corruption," McGraw says. Palin now attends the Wasilla Bible Church. She was there on August 17, just days before entering the national spotlight. David Brickner, the founder of Jews for Jesus, was a speaker. He told congregants that terrorist attacks on Israel were God's "judgment" of Jews who haven't embraced Christianity. Brickner said, "Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television. When a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment -- you can't miss it." The McCain campaign says Brickner's comments do not reflect her religious views. Palin's spokeswoman says she is pro-Israel. Pastor Ed Kalnin, the senior pastor of Palin's former Pentecostal church, has also come under fire for his comments. In 2004, he told church members if they voted for John Kerry for president, they wouldn't get into heaven. He told them, "I question your salvation." The Assembly of God issued a statement online in response, which said Kalnin was "joking" when he suggested "Kerry supporters would go to hell." The statement went on to say: "We do acknowledge in hindsight that it was careless, and we do apologize for that. This statement is not written as a defense, but as a clarification." Palin has done little while in office to advance a social conservative agenda. She told The Associated Press in an interview in 2006 that she would not allow her personal beliefs to dictate public policy. "I've honestly answered the questions on what my personal views are on things like abortion and a lot of controversial issues," Palin told AP. "I won't hesitate to answer those questions about what my personal views are, but I am not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else."  But in the last week, her religious background and outlook has certainly spurred debate far beyond Alaska.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-5-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are taking a cue from Beyonce and targeting "all the single ladies" in the hopes they can take over Republican held seats this November. Party officials recognize that Democrats' chances of retaking control of the House are remote at best, but by zeroing-in on unmarried women, who helped propel President Barack Obama to his second term, they believe they can shrink the GOP majority. Democrats have recruited female candidates in many competitive districts, crafted a message about how the current Republican agenda impacts women and created a technology program designed to identify unmarried women and get them to the polls this fall. More than 60% of the candidates included in the House Democrats' "red to blue" program - which funnels resources to top tier races - are women. Raising money, visiting the Veep . Recently, these candidates visited Washington to raise money, meet with Vice President Joe Biden and huddle with top leaders to get campaign advice. Aimee Belgard, an attorney, mom, and local elected official who is running to replace GOP Rep. Jon Runyan from New Jersey, emphasized in an interview with CNN that she'd be the first woman in a decade to be elected to the state's congressional delegation, if she wins. "As I'm out talking to them, they are glad to see someone who understands the issues that they are talking about - whether it's about the economy and their families, you know -- I can relate to that," Belgard told CNN. Congressional sisterhood a powerful voice for the voiceless . Iowa Democratic candidate Staci Appel, a former member of the State Assembly, touts her role pushing through Iowa's first statewide equal pay bill in 2009. She says Iowa has never elected a woman to a federal office, a fact she says she uses in her message to voters. "You're looking at a woman who is going to go out there and fight for you. So it gives you a strong reason to vote for somebody," Appel told CNN. Democratic candidate Martha Robertson is facing New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed, and says she and other female candidates are an antidote to the dysfunction in Washington. "We have bipartisan record of really getting things done. We have a guy who is just sitting in Washington just voting 'no' on everything and people want to see some change. They're tired of the fighting - we can make a difference," Robertson said. Dems see an opening . The results of the 2012 election show why Democrats believe they have an opening if they concentrate on single women. According to CNN's exit polls, unmarried women were about one quarter of the electorate in 2012, which was a record high. In that election, single women voted 68%-31% for Democrats over Republicans in congressional contests. Democrats admit they can't replicate that level in a non-presidential year, but they believe boosting turnout in several dozen districts can overtake the advantage Republicans traditionally have among married women. The House Democratic campaign arm is using the playbook developed by Virginia's Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in his victorious 2013 campaign. McAuliffe lost among men, but won the election because women supported him over the then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli by 9 points. Among unmarried women, the margin was more dramatic -- McAuliffe prevailed 67% -25%. The campaign committee created "ROSIE," a voter modeling program named after the iconic World War II "Rosie the Riveter," which they say stands for "Reengaging Our Sisters in Elections." This program culls data to identify unmarried voters, and then targets messages using email, paid mail and social media to motivate them to vote in November. The task to get these women motivated enough to go to the polls will be tough. Women building: GOP-led House to vote on women's museum . Seeking a narrative . A poll released last month by Democracy Corps, a Democratic leaning group, projects a 20-point drop off in unmarried female voters from 2012 to 2014. After seeing the impact of what happened in the 2010 midterm election when many women stayed home and Republicans gained the majority, Democratic candidates are talking about issues that hit unmarried women's pocketbooks -- an increase in the minimum wage, an extension for jobless benefits and legislation promoting equal pay. Democrats don't have the power in the House to move legislation on any of these items. But their campaign strategy includes turning losing battles on the House floor into a narrative to argue that House GOP members are ignoring issues that these women care about. "As long as Republicans keep blocking equal pay for equal work, restricting women's health choices and delaying the Violence Against Women Act, women will continue to run - and win - as Democrats," House Democratic campaign chairman Steve Israel told CNN. But Missouri GOP Rep. Ann Wagner, who is helping with the House Republican effort dubbed "Project Grow" to expand the party's female ranks in the House, told CNN that unmarried and married women care about the same issue this year -- jobs. She predicted this fall female voters overall will line up with the Republican economic agenda that includes job training, education, fixing the problems with Obamacare, and creating more energy jobs. "We're doers and we want to get things done. We want solutions, and we think we have message that resonates with all women," Wagner told CNN. As McAuliffe did in Virginia last year, House Democratic candidates are painting their Republican opponents with the broad brush of being right-wing ideologues that will endanger the priorities of women. Robertson said of Republican Rep. Reed, "He's completely tea party - he's the most extreme in New York State on his labor votes, on his shutdown votes, it's just across the board." Even if this group of female candidates does get elected to the House they will likely enter Congress as members of the minority - and the least senior. But they don't see that dynamic as a problem because they still believe they can have an impact serving their constituents. "I think electing more women and more people who want come up here and get things done -- that is what makes a difference. We're trying to change the environment." Appel told CNN.
