Severe weather is perilous anytime, of course, but CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says that tornado conditions are more dangerous during the night. "Tornadoes can be more deadly when people are sleeping and not paying attention to the warnings," he said. Scattered storms will soak Illinois and Missouri, and wind and hail will continue to be moderate in those states, the National Weather Service said. By Thursday afternoon, storms will hit parts of Indiana and Kentucky. Earlier this week, severe weather struck the South. Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia reported large hail. Residents in Shawnee, Oklahoma, were awakened early Wednesday morning by a severe storm producing golf ball-sized hail. "The hail came out of nowhere so it was kind of shocking," Sherri McDonald said to CNN in an iReport.

The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru supporters were brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage: 'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-1-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. "That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror," Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. "In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests," the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. "But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful." Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. "The timing is beyond a coincidence," he said. "We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward." Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. "The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA," he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, "Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a "fix" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises," in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering "a psychotic episode" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence "revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012," the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as "four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine." The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets "to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave," the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an "exemplary" character who "never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself," The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, which a neighbor described as "kind of like Mayberry," the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in "a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community." There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's "inland empire" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. "Academically, he was at the top of the top," Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so "when his life was over," court documents said. Holmes was "denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor," according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing "a lot of people" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a "behavioral evaluation and threat assessment" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. "Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team" in "the first 10 days" of June, but it "never came together" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of "dysphoric mania," a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. "It was," Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him "because I am bad news," the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: "Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved," they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, "justice is death," said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. "He is not a monster," Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is "morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill." "He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness," the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)Much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean this year, increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year. Almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy. The flows of migrants across the Mediterranean are unlikely to stop -- Italian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in Libya are waiting to cross, following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in Italy last year. These flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world, with a total estimate of 51.2 million people. The latest sinking has triggered some action in the European Union, which has unveiled a new ten-point action plan. The plan includes both deterrent mechanisms, such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system, but also an expansion of search-and-rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme, though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces. But some EU critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey. In a column published in the UK's Sun newspaper just hours before the sinking, Katie Hopkins declared: "It's time to get Australian. Bring on the gunships, force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats." Since then, Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has also suggested that Europe adopt a tougher approach, saying, "The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade. The only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats... That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the Mediterranean." So what would it mean if the EU did "get Australian" in its approach to asylum seekers? And could Australia's current policy be used as a global solution, or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the Mediterranean? There were dramatic changes in Australia's immigration policy in 2013, in the final months of the Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, which have been followed up and taken further by the current Liberal National coalition government, led by Abbott. In 2013, with bipartisan support of those two major parties, mainland Australia was legally "excised" from the migration zone. It was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in Australia. All people who seek to enter Australia by sea, under the Asylum Legacy Act, are no longer entitled to enter or stay in Australia while their refugee claims are processed. Instead, they can be transported to detention facilities in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. Alternatively, under a recent agreement, they can also agree to move to Cambodia. Beyond this, the Abbott government has also returned some boats to Indonesia without processing asylum seeker claims and, in two instances, to Sri Lanka following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board. That process was widely condemned by human rights advocates, given ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. That shift in policy under successive Labor and now the Liberal National governments in Australia has been chiefly designed as a deterrent: or, to use Tony Abbott's slogan, to "stop the boats". So has it worked? First, the numbers. If your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in Australia each year, then "no advantage" (meaning no asylum in Australia) and "stop the boats" (including the turning back of boats in international waters) has worked. In 2013, the Australian government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived; in 2014, there were 0. The current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn-backs. So we do not know how many boats tried to enter Australian waters with asylum seekers. It also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in Australian waters during the 2013-2014 period. Abbott explained the tactic of secrecy and turn-back in the following statement: "We are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers. And if we were at war, we wouldn't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves." If we accept that these responses have worked, the question for Australia's government is whether it is sustainable, and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger Asia Pacific region. In sum, if this policy had to end due to its financial cost, has this policy been a "solution"? The later years of the Howard administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001's "Pacific Solution," which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers. The Rudd government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability, leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the Rudd era. The earlier Howard years of deterrence did not provide long-term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers. At present, in the greater South-East Asian region, we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to Australian shores. The drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased, in particular, in the Bay of Bengal. At the same time, the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the Asia Pacific region has increased; they are just not making it to Australia yet. On cost alone, it is hard to see Australia's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in Europe. For Australia, these short-term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive. A 2014 report by the Guardian estimated that the Australian government may have spent as much as A$10 billion ($7.72 billion) on its detention policies since mid-2007-- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as A$440,000 ($343,000). For comparison, we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in Italy would cost A$75 billion ($58.5 billion). The Australian government's ability to "stop the boats" -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors, including tolerance from Indonesia, significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers. The consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in Australia for those who arrived by boat from July 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse, as we saw with the death of an Iranian refugee in the Regional Processing Center on Manus Island and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the Regional Processing Center in Nauru. The Australian government's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat, and then their relocation to Nauru or Papua New Guinea (or perhaps Cambodia), does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that Australia has to these populations. The operation to stop and return the boats, called "Operation Sovereign Borders" has been politically tumultuous for Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Returning boats to international waters potentially violates Australia's obligation to international maritime law; push-backs to Indonesian waters violates Indonesia's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk. In 2013 and 2014, the Australian government sought the Sri Lankan government's assistance to intercept those attempting to flee, and receive those who had already fled the country, at a time when that government was under investigation by the UN Human Rights Council for war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the situation in Europe illustrates, just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum. In the short term, the "stop the boats" approach appears to be working for the Australian government. It is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term. It certainly has not ended people smuggling or people's attempts to seek asylum in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Nando Sigona argues that the recent tragedy in Italy is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations, but requires consistent and long-term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows. This is a message that both the European Union and Australia should heed. Italy is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence. The Italian government ended its Mare Nostrum search and rescue program last autumn, which was effective but was also costing the Italian government €9.5 million per month. It was replaced by a much smaller European Union-run program, Operation Triton, which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and "more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives". In Italy, both Mare Nostrum and Operation Triton were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in North Africa. The migrants currently in Libya are in a perilous limbo, with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 Libyans and with Human Rights Watch noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has "eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of Libya." Second, such policies have significant legal implications. The Australian High Court has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of Australia's migration zone, an area that today includes all of Australian territory for the purposes of boat arrivals. By contrast, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2012 that efforts by the Italian government to return migrants intercepted at sea to Libya violated its legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights because the migrants "were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the Italian authorities." This suggests that similar practices to Australia's would be illegal under the European Convention. Copyright 2015 The Conversation. Some rights reserved.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)On the stage of a TV studio in Phnom Penh, Cambodian-American Ly Sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic, but familiar, story. On April 17, 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as Ly knew it was shattered when her hometown, the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. Ly, then 13, was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who, along with virtually the entire population of Phnom Penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work. Ly never saw them again, nor learned what happened to them. But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates. The urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence. Aimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years. Ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979. His killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States. For more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister. "I think she was the only family member to survive," she says, with tears in her eyes. As she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo. Ly embraces her sister and both women sob. "I missed you so much," Ly says. "I've always searched for you," Bo tells her. Since production began five years ago, the television show, "It's Not A Dream," has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help. The series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history. "The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia," said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult. She described the country as a "land of orphans." For decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims. In large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts. Far from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades. After fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west. They continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative. "In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades," said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies. Craig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that "for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room." The silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, "lacked the vocabulary" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society. The Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at "Year Zero" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy. "Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill," said Etcheson. "When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again." Even today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school. In an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said. Some were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the "killing fields" -- had really occurred, she added. The space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng. Founded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a "hybrid" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice. Intended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support. "We had great hope for this process," said Seng. "The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes." But the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.) This, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court. Seng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a "sham." For many victims, it is "too little, too late." OPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer Rouge . In the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. The court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's "Brother Number Two," and Khieu Samphan, "Brother Number Four," to life. Both men have appealed their convictions. In a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said. Two further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation. Three people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated. Olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004. Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal. Others are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings. Etcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an "imperfect vessel" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society. He said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society. "In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped," he added. Undoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece. Krisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die. "There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad," she said. Khieu Samphan, "Brother Number Four," published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his "Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual" in French in 2013. He told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound. "I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct," he said. For survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take. But for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet. On the stage of the "It's Not a Dream" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen. "Do you know the person in the video?" the show's host asks. "Yes," Ly says. "She is my mother." Moments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage. "Where have you two been?" Te asks. "I always worried about you two." "I thought you died," Ly says. The three women cry and embrace. "It is very miserable for all of us," the old woman says.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. "This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now," U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. "...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world." This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up "documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS" and correspondence with someone in Syria "asking him to target a church." Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. "A terrorist attack has been foiled," French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. "All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed," the video's narrator says in Arabic. "To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap." The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. "The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this," this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. "But the Christians never cooperated." Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. "(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down," recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. "And then, if you know, you go to the other side." This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as "a tricky way of doing business." "The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis," Jama said, claiming the group's militants are "bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight." Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a "total failure" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out "Oh God" and "Oh Jesus" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. "The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood," a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. "Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty," the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing "death by sword." Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. "This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away," Arabo told CNN. "Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst."</div></td></tr><tr>

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-7-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A senior Indonesian government official has praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Mr Abbott announced Australia's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered. 'Australia respects the Indonesian system, we respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot simply be business as usual,' Mr Abbott said. 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect'. 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week,' Ms Bishop said. The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies. Ms Bishop hasn't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Australia gives Indonesia about $600 million in aid annually, and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan. Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget, Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador. 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May,' she told reporters in Canberra. Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important' relationship with Indonesia. 'But it has suffered as a result of what's been done over the last few hours,' he said. 'Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I'm sure that every Australian's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time.' The Prime Minister said he understood people's anger at the executions, but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse. 'So I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse,' he said. 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important, remains important, will always be important, will become more important as time goes by. 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts. 'I don't and we shouldn't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible," he said. 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists.' Backlash begins: At 6am AEST, hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia' Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians. President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott's phone calls on the issue. Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day, one of Australia's most solemn days of remembrance. The Bali Nine duo's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers. In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others,' it read. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' Following the executions, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings, with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost. Nothing gained' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day.' Greens Leader Christine Milne said: 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment.' Stern words: Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions, parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted: 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty #RIP', tweeted. He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott, who said: 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture. Murder is murder.' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia. But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight, killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia. Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal. 'Nepal needs it more,' said Mr Robertson, who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances. Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart, Tanya Plibersek (right), have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC's 730 program on Tuesday evening, Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government. 'I don't intend to focus on the consequences,' she said. 'But of course, should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate, of course there will be have to be consequences. I don't want to go into the details.' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap, paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment. Late on Tuesday evening, the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo. The statement said: 'It is not too late to change your mind.' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-8-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Alastair Cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as England captain showed how to do it. There was agony for Cook on the third day of the second Test as he again fell short of the magic three figures despite looking as solid and unflustered at the crease as at any time in the two years since his last century. But the problems Cook had in finding fluency in his 211-ball 76 were put into stark perspective by yet another display of the rare class and maturity that has made Joe Root England’s outstanding batsman. Joe Root celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second Test against the West Indies . England's Root smashes a short ball to the boundary as West Indies keeper and captain Denesh Ramdin can only watch on . Root plays confidently off the back foot through the offside during a commanding innings once he got his chance on day three . Root and Gary Ballance run between wickets as they easily work the West Indian bowling around on a hot day in Grenada . Ben Stokes is giving a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs . This has been another slow, attritional Test in conditions that are hardly conducive to entertaining cricket. Yet as soon as Root took guard, batting at Grenada’s National Stadium was suddenly taken to another level. There were no problems for the Yorkshireman in reaching three figures — his sixth Test century and his first overseas — and his average has now reached a hundred since his return to the England team last summer. Here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by Cook and Jonathan Trott to give England a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on West Indies on the final day. Only a late burst of madness which saw Moeen Ali run himself out and Ben Stokes hit a Devendra Bishoo long-hop straight down deep square leg’s throat spoilt England’s day. They ended on 373 for six, a lead of 74, and Root and Jos Buttler will have to stick around for as long as possible on Friday if England are going to dictate terms. England captain Alastair Cook hits through the offside as he enjoys some width on day three of the second Test against the West Indies . Jonathan Trott cuts before the ball can reach Windies captain Ramdin's gloves on his way to 59 runs in the first innings . Cook congratulates Trott on his first Test half-century since returning to the England line-up in the morning session on Thursday . Trott plays the spinner behind point at the National Cricket Stadium in St George's, Grenada, on St George's Day . Opener Trott ducks a bouncer but leaves his bat hanging in the air from paceman Shannon Gabriel . Jermaine Blackwood clutches onto an edge from Trott off the bowling of Devendra Bishoo to end the opener's innings . Trott appears disappointed after the conditions appeared to favour the batsmen after they'd done the hard work early on . Root ’s fastest hundred for England, coming from 125 balls and including 13 fours, two sixes. This is his sixth Test century for his country. First 100 scored overseas. His previous high was 87 in Adelaide against Australia in 2013. In the past year he has scored four Test centuries . Root is the fifth England batsman  to score six consecutive 50s in Test innings. Since June 2014 he has scored 1,037 runs, averaging 103.7 . Root has featured in five of England’s past six Test partnerships of 150-plus runs. Alastair Cook has gone 34 innings and 697 days without a Test ton. Root said: ‘We had a blip towards the end but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on. Build a partnership with Jos tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once. ‘My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips in your career and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.’ While Root was the star of the day, this was hardly a failure for an England captain who has now made four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings, but Cook would have given anything to have been able to add those extra, elusive 24 runs. The brutal reality is that only Mike Brearley among England captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than Cook’s 34 innings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all. It is now 697 days since Cook made the last of his record 25 Test centuries, at Headingley against New Zealand way back in 2013 when everything seemed well with the world of England and their captain. Here Cook and Trott recorded England’s first century opening partnership for 31 innings as England went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield. The second-slowest half-century of Trott’s career, which was reached off 137 balls, was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as Cook after his double failure in Antigua. If Trott’s wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg-spin of Bishoo to second slip then Cook seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another Ashes. Not only had he been dropped on 29 on the second evening but  he survived an lbw shout on 65 on Thursday by a whisker when the deserving Bishoo saw his review of Steve Davis’ not out decision deemed umpire’s call. Just when Cook was looking at his best after lunch, Shannon Gabriel went round the wicket, bowled short and wide and somehow forced Cook to inside edge an attempted cut into his stumps. He stood for a moment, hunched over his bat, before trudging off with a score worth perhaps 20 more because of the slowness of the outfield but one that to Cook will seem not nearly enough. Trott summed up the mood of frustration, saying: ‘Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but you don’t spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match-defining hundreds.’ When Ian Bell also chopped on to Gabriel, a sure sign of a slow surface, West Indies were back in the match and England’s nerves were starting to fray. Yet that was to underestimate the extraordinary potential of the two exciting and prolific young Yorkshire batsmen in England’s middle order. The lack of touch and confidence that Gary Ballance displayed in the World Cup now looks light years away as he has returned to the Test form that made him the ICC’s emerging player of 2014. Ballance made 122 in Antigua and carried on here, bringing an urgency to England’s innings that was lacking when they managed just 69 runs in an extended morning session. Cook stands and waits for the result of a West Indies decision review after an LBW appeal was judged not out by the on-field umpire . Cook is lucky the umpire gave him not out initially after the ball pitched outside off and hit in line but was only just clipping the stumps . Cook hits aggressively behind square as Blackwood braces himself at the National Cricket Stadium . Cook checks on the welfare of Blackwood after his well-hit pull shot struck the close-in fielder . West Indies bowler Gabriel is a blur as he comes into his delivery stride on day three of the second Test . Cook's off stump is rattled and the bails fly off after a wide delivery from Gabriel found the skipper's inside edge . Gabriel and his team-mates celebrate as Cook leans on his bat in disappointment after being dismissed for 76 . Cook trudges off the field after a solid innings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left-handed opener . But if Ballance was busy then Root roistered along, reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125. He has been a class apart almost from the moment England recalled him, after leaving him out of the last Test of their Ashes humiliation, and restored him to the middle order where he belongs. This was his England record-equalling sixth successive Test score of 50 or more, a landmark shared with Patsy Hendren, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington and Cook himself. No Englishman has ever made seven in succession. At least not until Root bats again. Together, Root and Ballance took England beyond West Indies’ score after tea and added 165 before Marlon Samuels found a way through Ballance. The late flurry of activity, culminating in Stokes being given a salute as a send-off by his bete noire Samuels, reduced England’s chances of going to Barbados next week one up. But while there is Root, there is hope. A second drag-on for the St George's Day play came for England No 4 Ian Bell, who also cut Gabriel onto his off stump . An annoyed Bell has to make the long walk back to the pavilion after being dismissed for a disappointing one run . Bell inspects the inside edge that orchestrated his downfall in the first innings here after bringing strong form into the match . Root came out firing and punished any short deliveries, needing no second invitation to dispatch Bishoo to the boundary . Onside or offside, it didn't matter for Root as he raced past his half-century, taking full advantage of a tiring bowling attack . Ballance hits the spinner through the offside as he too made the West Indies pay for wayward bowling . Ballance raises his cherry-covered bat after reaching his half-century, following up his second-innings 122 in the first Test . Root and Ballance touch fists as they leave the field with their wickets in tact for the tea interval . Ballance can hardly believe it as he is bowled by a looping delivery from makeshift spinner Marlon Samuels . Ballance looks up in disbelief after his excellent innings comes to an end on 77 runs from 188 deliveries . Moeen Ali fails to get off the mark as he takes off for a single but is rightly sent back by Joe Root . Ramdin completed the run-out after the throw from Blackwood as Ali's first innings back in the England line-up ends with a duck . Ben Stokes doesn't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from Bishoo and skies his shot into the outfield . Stokes looks on in hope as his shot floats into the safe hands of Blackwood, who took his second catch of the day . After the pair clashed in West Indies first innings while Samuels batted, the all-rounder stood a saluted as Stokes left the field . Stokes looks at Samuels as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the send-off .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">As day two of the Grand National gets underway, thousands of ladies dressed in outrageous or elegant outfits as they compete in the style stakes and take in some high-class racing throughout the day. The popular event has seen over 45,000 descend on Aintree for the perfect build-up ahead of Saturday's main event, the Crabbies Grand National. Seven races make up the day as they saw Saphir Du Rheu, ridden by Sam Twiston-Davis, take home the Betfred Mildmay Novices' Chase and following up from his second place at the World Hurdle at Cheltenham festival. A.P McCoy rides Don Cossack and Eastlake in what is his last ever Grand National festival, as he looks to leave the racing scene and his legacy with a bang. Side boob alert! Some of the racegoers ended up flashing a bit more flesh than they bargained for . Hoping to be noticed: Ms Brown had certainly dressed to attract the attention of photographers in her newsprint dress and scarlet heels . Steady! A lady needs some help getting off Aintree's racing simulator, but a bride-to-be had no problems hanging on . Glugging on the go: Ladies enjoy a drink while moving through the racecourse ahead of the first race . Uh oh! Ms Brown also fell victim to the day's first wardrobe malfunction when a breeze blew her skirt up to reveal a paucity of underwear . Getting the giggles: A lady chats seriously on the phone while another just can't hide her smile as she strolls around the course . Great day out: Two ladies burst into peals of laughter as they enjoy their day out at Aintree . Full length: Floor-length dresses in summery floral print also proved a hit, with many ladies teaming them with summery sandals . And relax: Ladies perch on a piece of astro-turf and check their phones while enjoying a drink . Ladies in red: Along with bridal white, cheerful crimson also struck a chord with the ladies and it proved a popular choice . Nice dress! A quartet of ladies show off their stylish side as they strike a pose for photographers while making their way into the course . Colourful: Many of the racegoers arriving for Ladies' Day had plumped for bold brights - red was among the favourites . Showing some skin: A couple of ladies opted to flash the flesh and showed off plenty of cleavage as well as a few tattoos . Go on!

Bright spark: Bold colour was a popular choice for the second day in a row with bright pink and pale blue taking an early lead . Tenterhooks: Earlier, the lady had looked nervous while watching the second race of the day, the Doom Bar Maghull Novices' Chase . Stripes galore: One of summer's hottest trends is stripes - and the ladies of Aintree were happy to make the most of it . Dancing queen: A lady gives the cameras a twirl while crossing the racecourse in her high heels . Oops!

Looking lovely: Ladies sported a variety of different looks, with black and white, maxi dresses and peplums all proving popular . Quite the look: A lady steps out in a floor-length orange dress slashed to somewhere beyond the thigh . Along with low-cut dresses, the clunky platform shoes that have become a Grand National staple in recent years were very much on show as were some unflatteringly tight get-ups. Most, however, were simply intent on enjoying the sunshine and, in some cases, the revels with many opting to start their day with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. But while many joined in with the fun, the sight of so many early morning drinkers has left bookmakers panicking at the prospect of a bumper payout following Coral's decision to offer odds on such wardrobe malfunctions as falling over while drunk and showing off too much cleavage. 'If some of yesterday's outfits were anything to go by, we're in for a treat today for Ladies' Day at Aintree,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady, whose company has priced falling over at 1/2 and exposed breasts and bottoms at 2/1. Cheers! A pair of ladies, both in spectacular fascinators, enjoy a bottle of Moët & Chandon champagne . Flashing the flesh: Some of the ladies had clearly ignored the part of the style code that advises against excess cleavage . Time for a touch up: A lady freshens up her eye make-up from her perch on a spare bit of asphalt . Much better! A lady kicks off her platform shoes and replaces them with a comfy pair of flip flops .

Watching the action: Racegoers clad in an array of cheerful summery brights watch the action unfold . Careful! A lady teeters forward as she watches her horse gallop home in the second race of the day . Break to pose! The ladies left drinking and sunbathing alone briefly while waving cheerfully at a passing photographer . Brilliant fun: A hen party appears to be making the most of their day out and make a bright splash of colour against the grey concrete . Getting the giggles: A lady chats seriously on the phone while another just can't hide her smile as she strolls around the course . Party! Racegoers are clearly having a great time as they share a bottle of champagne while enjoying the sunshine . Hello sunshine: Many racegoers appeared to have dressed for August and clearly wanted to make the most of the lovely weather . Sunbathing: Ladies huddle on a tarmac concourse as they enjoy a drink while topping up their tans . First faller!

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-10-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-11-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Everyone loves a bargain, even in the mega-rich territory of the Barclays Premier League. Where else to look for a steal than in the bargain basement? That is where clubs at the top level can look down at the Championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress. Yet it can be a case of hit and miss. Here, Sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the Premier League, and others who can do so too. Aaron Cresswell (Ipswich Town to West Ham in July 2014 – £2million) The full-back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team's Premier League games this season . Cresswell began at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut in November 2008. From there, he moved to Ipswich in June 2011, apparently turning down West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster Rovers. He won the Supporters Player of the Year award, and was linked with Aston Villa. Yet it was West Ham who signed the left-back on a five-year contract, spending just £2m in doing so. Cresswell has made 32 appearances in the Premier League since, and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of Manchester City and Chelsea. Both clubs need to add more home-grown talent to their squads, and the West Ham regular would add to that batch. Aaron Cresswell has proved a good fit for the Premier League since signing for West Ham in July 2014 . John Stones (Barnsley to Everton in January 2013 - £3m) Stones has the best passing accuracy of any Everton player this season - 90.8% . A Barnsley youth product, Stones made 25 appearances in the Championship for the club, before leaving for Everton on a five-and-a-half-year deal. It reportedly cost them £3m, and he has made 38 appearances in the Premier League since. Despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10-14 weeks, Stones was nominated for the Golden Boy 2014 award alongside Gerard Deulofeu, Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. During his time in the top flight, he has earned four caps for England. Another potential star. John Stones signed for Everton from Barnsley in January 2013 for just £3m and has been a good addition . Andrew Robertson (Dundee United to Hull City in July 2014 - £2.85m) Robertson has made 40 dribbles this year, 17 more than any other Hull defender . No disrespect to Dundee United or the Scottish Premiership, but it is widely assumed that the Premier League is somewhat of a step up. Some make it, some don't. Robertson can class himself in the former category. The Hull youngster has thrived since moving to the KC Stadium in July 2014, and even scored against England for Scotland four months later. Steve Bruce, the Hull manager, admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the Glasgow-born left-back, who has made 21 appearances in the Premier League. Andrew Robertson joined Hull from Dundee in July 2014 and is pictured a month after signing . Leonardo Ulloa (Brighton to Leicester City in July 2014 - £8m) The striker is the Foxes' top scorer in the league this season (7) while no other Leicester player has had a hand in more goals (scored seven, assisted two) Ulloa didn't come cheap. Yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the Premier League. The Argentinian with no caps cost £8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club Brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the Premier League. It proved a shrewd move at first. The goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight. Nine goals in total as the club's top scorer. Yet with Leicester bottom of the table, Ulloa has a task on his hands to help them survive, otherwise he may well be rendered a Championship player once more come May. Leonardo Ulloa didn't come cheap for Leicester and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league . Dwight Gayle (Peterborough to Crystal Palace in July 2013 - £4.5m) After netting five in his first 15 Premier League appearances, Gayle has now gone eight games without a goal for Palace . Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League. He started at Stansted, currently a club that play in the ninth level on the footballing pyramid. From there, he joined Dagenham & Redbridge, before being sent on loan to Conference North side Bishop's Stortford. Yet it was during a loan spell with Peterborough that he truly got his chance. Playing in the Championship helped him progress and he signed for Crystal Palace in 2013. He has made 46 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals, and is a regular. Dwight Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League with Crystal Palace . Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace to Southampton in July 2012 - £2.15m) The England man has made 99 tackles, the third-highest total in the Premier League this season and the most by a defender . Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product, and made his professional debut in October 2008. Later, Neil Warnock would state Clyne has a 'bright future in the game', and he wasn't wrong. After four years at Selhurst Park in the Championship, winning the Player of the Year award in his final season, Clyne moved to Southampton for £2.15m. It's proved a bargain. The right-back is a regular at St Mary's, and even made his debut for England in October 2014. All this has led the 24-year-old to be linked with Chelsea and Manchester United. The rise continues. Nathaniel Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product but signed for Southampton after their promotion . Dele Alli (MK Dons to Tottenham Hotspur in February 2015 - £5m – to join next season) Alli has netted 14 goals for the MK Dons this season, more than any other midfielder for a single club . Bit of a cheat this one. Alli meets the criteria, having never played in the top flight before and signing for a Premier League club, yet he awaits his debut for Tottenham. The midfielder signed for £5m from MK Dons, but was sent back on loan for the remainder of the season. Will he follow in the footsteps of Cresswell,  Clyne, and so on? Time will tell. Dele Alli signed for Tottenham Hotspur from MK Dons for £5m before being sent back on loan . So, who could be next to move up to the Premier League? Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth) Position: Winger. Age: 25. League appearances: 40. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Benik Afobe (Wolves) Position: Striker. Age: 22. League appearances: 27. Goals: 22. What else can you say but Afobe has more goals than a certain Harry Kane this season? The former Arsenal striker is surely on a shortlist or two for Premier League clubs. He scored his 30th goal of the season against Birmingham City on Saturday. Time to step up? Benik Afobe has been in prolific form this season first for MK Dons on loan then for Wolves . Demarai Gray (Birmingham) Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 18. League appearances: 24. Goals: 5. Just 18 years old, Gray burst into the Birmingham team in 2013. In doing so he has began to be called up for England's youth sides, making three appearances for the Under 18s and four for the Under 19s. Birmingham had to reject four bids from Bournemouth who were keen to sign the starlet, even offering £3.5m which could rise to £4m with add-ons. Can they hold on to him for much longer, though? Demarai Gray is wanted by a host of clubs but Birmingham are determined to try to keep hold for now . Bradley Johnson (Norwich) Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. League appearances: 37. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League, where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney (Watford) Position: Striker. Age: 26. League appearances: 33. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Troy Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Will Hughes (Derby County) Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. League appearances: 34. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako (Wolves) Position: Winger. Age: 26. League appearances: 35. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4m from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton . OCTOBER 2013 . Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014 . After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014 . England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014 . Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014 . Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014 . England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014 . England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014 . Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015 . England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015 . Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role . Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role . Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure . Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician . Verdict: Vulnerable . Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media . Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable . Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible . Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-13-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident Dundee United dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic Treble. ‘I believe we can win all three trophies,’ trumpeted goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. ‘People might laugh at me but maybe in May we will have won the league and cups and I will be laughing.’ On Wednesday night against Dundee at Dens Park, however, those carefree early January days seemed so long ago as Cierzniak’s grip of the ball for Greg Stewart’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara is under pressure following his side's recent slump . Dundee United failed to get their hands on the Scottish League Cup  as they fell to a 2-0 defeat by Celtic . Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United have failed to win any of their last 10 games . As United slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years, the loss at Dens Park saw Jackie McNamara’s team make it 10 matches without a win. It’s not yet May but nobody is laughing at Tannadice as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park. It does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years; qualified for European competition in three of the last four years; finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. Yet as United have dropped like a stone from early-season table-toppers to potentially even missing out on Europe, the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about McNamara’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales. Those close to Tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans, board and manager; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over McNamara’s future. Ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters’ group ArabTRUST, one leading fan told Sportsmail of ‘overwhelming unhappiness’ with McNamara’s bonus, while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned. There is, he added, a growing belief among fans that the manager’s position is ‘untenable’. But this has been a slow-burning civil war. The seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman Stephen Thompson took the unpopular decision to sell star players Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic. As furious fans pointed out, hadn’t Thomson used the eve of last May’s Scottish Cup Final defeat by St Johnstone to declare Tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus, as occurred after the Scottish Cup win in 2010 under Peter Houston? Dundee United sold Stuart Armstrong (left) to Celtic during the January transfer window . Gary Mackay-Steven also sealed a winter move to Celtic on transfer deadline day . The Tannadice supremo even went as far as name-checking Armstrong along with Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson as players he would like to keep for ‘at least another year’ to help ‘compete’ with Celtic. Gauld and Robertson were quickly sold for £3million each last summer, although the fees for both made the sales palatable. Yet parting with Armstrong and Mackay-Steven just 48 hours after reaching a League Cup Final against a Celtic side Thompson had vowed to ‘compete’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file. ‘I thought it was a strange decision, I must admit,’ said former United defender and BBC analyst Mark Wilson recently. ‘I can understand letting Mackay-Steven go because he had signed a pre-contract with Celtic but Armstrong is a different case. ‘United were in touching distance of Celtic and if you are serious about challenging, then you can sell him in June. ‘I read McNamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books. But they sold Gauld and Robertson for substantial fees in the summer and I read the chairman talking about how great the club’s finances are. ‘It was just a bit odd. Especially selling to Celtic, a rival, rather than an English team.’ At first, United closed ranks to slap down their detractors, reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season. Dundee United striker Ryan Dow has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season . Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . After starting life post-Armstrong and Mackay-Steven with a comprehensive 3-0 Scottish Cup victory at Stranraer, the line spun was that the two players, while talented, did not constitute a two-man team. They were at pains to point out that as United stormed to the top of the Premiership at the start of the season, Armstrong was often injured while an off-form Mackay-Steven was regularly left on the bench. Indeed, it was argued that, together, the duo started just three of United’s first nine games of the campaign, of which McNamara’s side won seven, drew one and lost one. After that Stair Park victory, two-goal Ryan Dow was hailed as the man to step into Armstrong and Mackay-Steven’s goalscoring boots. Dow has not hit the net since. Worryingly, United then slumped to their first back-to-back defeats of the season and went on to lose the League Cup Final to Celtic. Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . Over the course of four March meetings with Ronny Deila’s men, United were dispatched from the Scottish Cup and defeated in the league, too, as McNamara’s season started to disintegrate. As the heat rose on Thompson, the United chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint. Curiously, though, the spotlight would then eventually turn on McNamara as ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £6.3m worth of transfer fees for Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. United continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that McNamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers. Even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans. Their new-found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by United losing five-in-a-row for the first time since May 2006. Amid this poor run, St Johnstone defender Frazer Wright recently claimed that if McNamara’s men fall behind, ‘it gets in their heads’ and they ‘argue amongst themselves’. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . Defeat at Tannadice against hapless Hamilton — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable, even if victory would clinch a top-six finish for city rivals Dundee. There are those within Dens Park who sense a real opportunity to become the first Dark Blues side to finish above United in the league since 2002-03. A loss, coupled with a win for on-form Dundee at St Johnstone, would see Paul Hartley’s men go above United in the table on Saturday. Few could have guessed that scenario when, in the first hours of 2015, United took Dundee apart in a record 6-2 derby win at Tannadice. Not least Paul Heffernan, who, as a Hibs player, was impressed by United in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Easter Road in the League Cup in October before McNamara’s side sneaked through on penalties. ‘I’m sure the fans would love us to finish above United — and it’s all to play for,’ said the Irish striker, who scored the third in Dundee’s 3-1 win at Dens on Wednesday night. ‘We’re only two points behind United now, so we’ve just got to keep going when the split comes. Dundee United's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . ‘I’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win. When I was still at Hibs earlier this season, we played them in the League Cup and they were a very good side. ‘It’s a long time not to win but they’ve still got very good players in the team. I’m sure they will come good again. ‘I’d actually like it if they came good against Hamilton on Saturday, though. That would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top-six. ‘So here’s hoping they can turn it around on Saturday because it would help us. It would be ironic, I know, if United clinched us a top-six place. ‘But we go to St Johnstone knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there.’ While the tangerine half of Dundee mourns its fall from grace, the Dark Blues are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to November 2004. ‘Ending that run against United was a big motivating factor — and I felt that was the best I’ve seen us play,’ said Heffernan. ‘A lot of the players haven’t been here that long. But, for the sake of the fans who haven’t witnessed a win over United for such a long time, it was really important. We did it for them. I’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come.’ After a long era in the shadow of their neighbours, Dundee are daring to dream. Amid a tangerine nightmare, however, for a United side in crisis, the Treble that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title . CHENNAI SUPER KINGS . The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final . £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS . The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team . KINGS XI PUNJAB . After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title . KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS . The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League . MUMBAI INDIANS . The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. Mumbai Indians batsman Rohit Sharma pictured in action for India against Bangladesh at the World Cup . 2008: Rajasthan Royals . 2009: Deccan Chargers (defunct) 2010: Chennai Super Kings . 2011: Chennai Super Kings . 2012: Kolkata Knight Riders . 2013: Mumbai Indians . 2014: Kolkata Knight Riders . RAJASTHAN ROYALS . Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan . Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals . ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE . Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots. Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament . South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket . SUNRISERS HYDERABAD . The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL . Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)More than 4,600 people dead. More than 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal. One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on Saturday. And some of the grim figures are likely to get even worse as hopes of rescuing any more survivors diminish every hour. Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across this shell-shocked nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years. As the country coped with the fallout of the quake, another natural disaster struck Tuesday afternoon in a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu, and up to 200 people were feared missing as a result of a landslide, a trekking association official said. It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. "We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain," said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. "Many people are crying, sharing their hardships," he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. "This is not the time to rest and lament," he said. "This is the time to go out and save lives." Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. "Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help," he said. "We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves." Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. "Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime," he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. "We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up," Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. "We cannot say by how much exactly." The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was "on a war footing" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. "The biggest problem is reaching these villages," Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. "The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it," he said. "We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them." Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs "huge and urgent." "The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts," he said. "I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed." A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. "Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there," Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain. China has canceled all climbs on its side of the mountain, the official news agency Xinhua reported. Are you in Nepal or do you have loved ones affected?

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescue crews and residents in Nepal early Sunday began the desperate search for survivors after a magnitude-7.8 quake near the capital of Kathmandu a day earlier flattened homes, buildings and temples, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1,800 people. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake . Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far "is really based on the information we have from the main cities," Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN.  "But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed." The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. "The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise," said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. "It is clear that very many lives have been lost." An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. "It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life," Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. "It was utterly terrifying." Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. "Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful," Heanue said. "There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake." The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed.  Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be "the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934." In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. "This region is no stranger to earthquakes," he said. "A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book." Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. "We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything," he said. "There was no chance that they survived." Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. "A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive." Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. "Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. "It felt like it went on forever," the California resident said. Witnesses: "People are panicked, running down to street" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. "People were screaming and looking around," he said. "There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying." Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. "Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years," he said. "Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes." Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. "Everybody's in shock," he said. "They never felt an earthquake that big." Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. "With every minute the situation becomes worse," he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. "To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies," Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. "The United States stands with you during this difficult time. How to help the earthquake victims . At a hospital in the Nepalese capital, people with broken bones and head injuries were lying outside, with doctors administering CPR to at least one of them. Residents with scrapes and lacerations were  turned away for those in need of more urgent care. Fast Facts on earthquakes . The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it. A strong aftershock of magnitude 6.6 was recorded a little more than a half-hour afterward, along with nearly three dozen other aftershocks, the USGS reported. The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from "severe" to "violent," nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0. The shaking was rated as "strong" to "severe" on the USGS ShakeMap. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported that roads in the area were out. IBN reporter K. Dhiksit looked out his window in Kathmandu and saw the collapsed walls of many buildings. As he watched, an aftershock rattled the street. He heard "big booming sounds," he said, and saw people fleeing into the streets. How are earthquakes measured? Photos of caved-in and toppled buildings appeared on social media. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet, "We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home & in Nepal."

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-17-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Manchester United's humiliation of their noisy neighbours City at Old Trafford led the club's official website to claim the city was turned red once more in the space of 90 minutes. Yet was this the case? Was that 4-2 win a sign that United are the dominant force in Manchester again, or should we just chalk it off as nothing more than a bad game for the defending champions? City had, after all, beaten United four consecutive times going into the derby, so should the red half of Manchester be so confident sitting four points ahead? Here is Sportsmail's verdict on the issues. Is Manchester red again? Of course not, it is neither red or blue. United’s website declared this to be the case and they will rightly revel in Sunday’s victory for a while. What perhaps best sums up City’s current plight, meanwhile, is that they have been dragged back in to this parochial little squabble at all. Manuel Pellegrini and his players began this season with aspirations of defending their Barclays Premier League title and making an impact on the Champions League. Manchester United's players celebrate together during the derby win for the red half of the city . Juan Mata salutes the Old Trafford crowd while Ashley Young and Wayne Rooney celebrate his goal . With United setting their own sights no higher than a return to the top four, the club from the other side of town were the least of their worries. Yet here we are in April with City already being lapped by league leaders Chelsea and United now easing away from them in third. It’s a remarkable state of affairs even if a look at the fixture list does offer City some semblance of hope. United’s next two games are at Chelsea and Everton, and they still have a home fixture with Arsenal and a visit to Crystal Palace to follow. City, on the other hand, have four home games you would expect them to win and away matches at Spurs and Swansea. Can City take maximum points between now and the end of the season? In theory they could but that would take some doing from a team that looks to be on the floor. At the Etihad they spoke of ‘trajectory’ the day they hustled Mark Hughes out of the door in 2009 and it is a word that neatly works to sum up the differences between red and blue. Apr 18 - Chelsea (a) Apr 26 - Everton (a) May 2 - West Brom (h) May 9 - Crystal Palace (a) May 17 - Arsenal (h) May 24 - Hull City (a) Apr 19 - West Ham (h) Apr 25 - Aston Villa (h) May 3 - Tottenham Hotspur (a) May 10 - QPR (h) May 17 - Swansea City (a) May 24 - Southampton (h) United won the battle against City but the war is still ongoing with six Premier League games remaining . United manager Louis van Gaal thanked supporters for their patience after Sunday's victory . Why do United suddenly look like a good team again? Their manager Louis van Gaal has not been too proud to learn from his mistakes. He was the only person in Manchester, for example, who thought that Wayne Rooney was a central midfielder and Ander Herrera a substitute. Eventually he recognised his folly and United have improved. Van Gaal has also had the courage to pick players on form not reputation. This is why we now see Radamel Falcao on the bench, Daley Blind playing ahead of the expensive Luke Shaw – regardless of Shaw’s recent injury – and Juan Mata ahead of Angel di Maria. At times, Van Gaal’s hand has been forced by injuries but his faith in players such as Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia – players whose Old Trafford career looked over during pre-season – has its roots in what he has seen on the training field. In many ways, this United team now resembles his Dutch team of the World Cup. It seems to lack depth and real quality but still it manages to get the job done. Mata runs away in celebration after scoring one of United's four goals against their great rivals City . Rooney, Young and Mata celebrate as they all rightfully earn their first-team places for United . Angel di Maria (third right) and Radamel Falcao (right) were left out of the starting XI by Van Gaal on Sunday . What has been the secret behind the renaissance of players like Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini? Van Gaal is a coach’s coach who believes in the value of the training ground. A man who swears by systems and training ground drills, the United manager has followed a mantra of ‘repeat, repeat, repeat’ ever since he arrived in Manchester and, at last, it has paid off. In his early days at the club some of the United players worried that their new manager’s love of endless passing drills would eventually bore them to death. Some even thought they were contributing to the squad’s spate of muscle injuries. Over time, however, Van Gaal’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young, Fellaini and indeed central defender Chris Smalling have particularly benefited. United do not play predictable football but it is a game hung very firmly to a structure. That is one of the reasons why, for example, a back four without a single stellar player has conceded fewer goals than everybody bar Chelsea and Southampton this season. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail snapper Ian Hodgson . Young celebrates after bringing United level having earlier trailed against City from the eighth minute . Players once moaned about, such as Fellaini and Young, are now pivotal parts of United's team . Van Gaal’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young and Fellaini have benefited . Didn't Louis van Gaal consider selling Fellaini last summer? Yes, he did. Oddly, it was only an injury that prevented the Belgian joining Napoli in loan last August but again Van Gaal’s treatment of Fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams. Van Gaal certainly has an ego but it isn’t allowed to get in the way of decision making. He began the season convinced that 3-4-1-2 was the way forward for this United team and certainly there would have been no room for Fellaini in that system. But time – not to mention performances – persuaded Van Gaal that there was greater value in other methods. At City, Pellegrini has been rather more stubborn. Over the course of the season the South American has refused to recognise the problems of using Yaya Toure as part of a central midfield pair and indeed the fact that his favoured 4-4-2 system can lead to his side being overrun in the middle of the field against really good teams. Fellaini helped as United tore City apart at Old Trafford to move four points clear of their noisy neighbours . Fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams . It was only an injury that prevented Fellaini from joining Napoli in loan last August from United . Should Manuel Pellegrini be worried about his position at City? 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. Yes, he should. As has been reported here before, City do not wish to sack their manager and it is still highly possible they may not. However, footballers’ body language can undo a manager almost as quickly as results and, from that point of view, the signs were bad for Pellegrini at Old Trafford. For all United’s improvement, they are not a side that should be putting four past the champions but this was a City team seemingly unwilling to run, chase and do the ugly stuff on Sunday and the club’s hierarchy have noticed. It remains fashionable to blame players such as Toure for City’s failings and it seems inevitable the Ivorian will leave this summer. However, when players like David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta and James Milner start to disappear from the battle then you know you have a problem. There was a time when Pellegrini’s level approach to life was viewed as one of his assets but at the moment there are those at City who are beginning to wonder when the Chilean is going impose himself on a dressing room that has sleep walked its way towards calamity in recent weeks. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at City after losing against their fierce rivals . Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a United goal . Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans off at Old Trafford as he and goalkeeper Joe Hart leave the pitch . What does the summer hold for both clubs? United will spend heavily on key positions such as central defence and centre forward and also buy a right back. The future, meanwhile, does not look bright for players such as Falcao and Adnan Januzaj. City will also be back in the market, with executives confident that increased revenue from commercial activity and sponsorship will allow them to operate within the constraints of Financial Fair Play and still spend on players such as Paul Pogba from Juventus. Van Gaal’s insistence on a reduced pre-season tour will see travelling kept within reason and it would appear the Dutch coach has won a key battle with the club there. Pellegrini, meanwhile, may wish he had put his own foot down in that area. City will visit Canada, New York and one other venue on a post-season trip – though there will be no actual game in NYC – while a pre-season venture to Australia and Indonesia looks set to total somewhere in the region of 21 days. In this area, the two men are different. Van Gaal – not without his own flaws – has developed in to a manager of his football club in a way, for example, that David Moyes never did. Pellegrini, for his part, remains a head coach. Falcao came on as a second-half substitute for Fellaini at Old Trafford against City .

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

Devastating: The deadly fire broke out near half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985 . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the burning stand . His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

The release of the book coincides with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, with English football set for a minute's silence ahead of all games on April 25, which will be Bradford's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much consternation in the West Yorkshire city. 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.</div></td></tr><tr>

An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to the 15-year-old boy from the seven-storey Hilton Guesthouse. Speaking shortly before he was rescued, Andrew Olvera, who was heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'He's not too far down. 'But the floors have collapsed and he'd pancaked between them.' Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors were hanging down in front like curtains. 'The whole operation is dangerous,' he said. 'But its risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.'

Father Shyam Awal worked tirelessly with friends and neighbours to try to free the boy, digging with their bare hands through the rubble. But without the proper equipment it was impossible. The frantic mother could not sleep or eat throughout the 22-hour separation from her young son. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission. Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver told MailOnline: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.'

While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 'There may not be any more survivors,' said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal's home ministry. 'The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.' Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared yesterday with protests outside parliament. Villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake had risen to 5,489 by Thursday morning. Almost 11,000 were injured, and more than 80 were also killed in neighbouring India and Tibet. Many people have been sleeping in the open after the quake - the United Nations has said 600,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Workers excavate bodies as they take part in a rescue operation at Kolache-2 in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu . Countries and organisations around the world have rushed to help Nepal, where the massive 7.8 magnitude quake has killed around 5,000 people .

Lives ruined: People sort through the rubble of buildings which collapsed in Sathighar, north of Kathmandu . It has said eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. Dandal said foreign rescue teams had told him that their work is almost done because there is little chance of finding any survivors. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepali army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official. China is expected to send helicopters today, he said. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in. Nepalese soldiers use lime powder as a prevention measure against disease at a  tent site in Kathmandu . People walk past a collapsed building in the UNESCO world heritage site of Bhaktapur outside Kathmandu . That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the nation of 28 million people sandwiched between India and China. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Guna Raj, who works for a Kathmandu-based NGO specialising in providing sanitation, said there have been outbreaks of diarrhoea in relief camps because of a shortage of toilets and clean water. 'In the next few days or weeks I am sure there will be an outbreak of epidemics,' said Raj, who is involved in the relief effort. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by an avalanche on Tuesday. But at least two foreigners, whose nationalities were as yet unknown, were found dead, the home ministry said. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Washington (CNN)In 2011, al Qaeda took Warren Weinstein hostage. Then, about a year later, his family paid money to his captors, said a Pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers. It did not lead to the American aid worker's release, and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in January, the White House announced Thursday. After the transfer of funds in 2012, the captors, who never referred to themselves as "al Qaeda," but instead as "Afghans," began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for Weinstein, most prominently Dr. Aafia Siddiqui of Pakistan, the source said. She has been described as the "poster girl" for Islamic jihad and is serving an 86-year sentence in the United States. The militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the Pakistani province of Waziristan, along the Afghan border, the source said. The men on the other end of the phone spoke Pashto with an accent typical for the border region. And they were professional in their dealings, said the source, who noticed a marked change after the money was paid. The people who had originally talked to the source about Weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone. The militants also connected themselves with other terror events. After ISIS beheaded American James Foley, Weinstein's Afghan captors told the source that "the Iraqis" were asking for the American and that they were preparing an "orange suit" for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when ISIS militants murdered them. When the Taliban released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of Bergdahl's kidnappers. They had said, at one point, that if they did kill Weinstein, they'd announce it in a big way, because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate. The captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012, and the last time the source spoke with them, in early April, they said that Weinstein was still alive. In spite of a request for proof of life, the militants didn't give one. After that, the calls stopped. The source never had a number for the militants; they had always been the ones who called. The source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors, leaving the disclosure to Weinstein's family. Could Weinstein have been saved? Weinstein's family in Maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to Congress. Weinstein's wife, Elaine, and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one's plight -- especially media attention -- would make Weinstein, a government contractor working with USAID in Pakistan, a more valuable hostage to his al Qaeda captors. But the family switched course and went to their representatives in Congress in late 2013 after a video of Weinstein -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt "totally abandoned and forgotten" by his country. Will the drone debate return? More than a year later, that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the Weinsteins and the Maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed Weinstein's case with the Obama administration as well as Pakistan. The congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one, according to one of those lawmakers and a Senate aide. "We don't get choked up too often at work," Algene Sajery said as she held back tears. "But this is really hard." Sajery is a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, who worked closely on the case. After the White House announced that Weinstein had been accidentally killed in a January U.S. drone strike, the aide's first call was to Weinstein's daughters. "Myself and my colleague worked really closely with them, talked to them all the time ... they're just such good people," Sajery said of the family. "There's a personal connection there." Cardin and his staff had tracked the Weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in August 2011, but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case, Cardin's staff joined forces with Rep. John Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, and began setting up meetings for the family. Cardin's staff set up meetings for the senator and Weinstein's family with everyone from the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Pakistani ambassador in Washington. Cardin and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, wrote to President Barack Obama, calling on the U.S. to beef up efforts to secure Weinstein's release and dedicate more resources to the cause. And the staff and lawmakers helped the Weinsteins weave through the network of agencies -- from the FBI to the State Department and the White House -- working to bring Weinstein home. "We focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated," Delaney told CNN on Thursday. "The government is a bureaucracy, and you have to make sure that it's working." But for the Weinsteins and the families of other American hostages held by terror groups abroad, the government hasn't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on Capitol Hill who worked to help them. Al Qaeda hostage Warren Weinstein killed . "Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. Government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years," Elaine Weinstein said in a statement Thursday. "We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. Government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families." It's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of American hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient U.S. government efforts to bring their loved ones home. Delaney was "saddened, disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring Warren home," he said in a statement Thursday. And in an interview with CNN later in the day, he strayed away from blaming the Obama administration or people in various U.S. agencies, instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system. The Weinstein family's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when Bergdahl, the U.S. Army sergeant, was released by a Taliban-affiliated group in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay prisoners. The U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception. "It's one of those things where it's both there's some hope, but at the same time it caused them some great frustration," Delaney recalled, saying the family asked: "Why not Warren?" But as the State Department called the Bergdahl exchange a "unique situation," the Weinsteins' hopes were dashed. "That's when they asked us to really step up our efforts," Sajery said. "That's when they decided to really go public." Delaney introduced a resolution calling on the Obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring Weinstein home and make his return -- and that of other U.S. hostages abroad -- a top priority. Mikulski, Cardin and Sens. Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk of Illinois pushed a similar resolution in the Senate. And the Weinsteins took to the airwaves, with Alisa Weinstein appearing on CNN's "AC360" to make a public appeal for her father's release -- and for the U.S. government to do more to secure his freedom. "My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad," she said on CNN last June. "You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there." White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday said that "significant resources" were dedicated to try to free Weinstein and that "as painful as it is," the U.S policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more Americans at risk. And State Department acting spokeswoman Marie Harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the Weinsteins throughout the process. While the U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, the State Department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of American hostages held by terrorists abroad, she said. The White House announced the review last fall, which Obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped Americans abroad. Speaking at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday, Obama reiterated that the White House will review what happened. "We all bleed when we lose an American life," he said. "We all grieve when any innocent life is taken. We don't take this work lightly." Obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall, noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified, while only their failures become public. "The world doesn't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent, or the terrorist attacks you thwart, or the lives that you save," Obama said. "It can be frustrating sometimes, but that's part of the function of our democracy. But I know what you do." But Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing American hostages held abroad. Delaney on Thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the U.S. find American hostages -- an effort he's been pushing in recent months. The tragedy of Weinstein's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms. "I think that every single American wants any American held hostage returned," Delaney said. "There's tremendous support to do more." On Friday, Elaine Weinstein said in a statement that the family has "been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world." "We appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the Warren we loved so much as well as those who did not," the statement said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals."
