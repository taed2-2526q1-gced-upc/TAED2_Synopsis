CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Social networking sites are offering new opportunities to criminals. We're gonna explain what you should watch out for. I'm Carl Azuz, and you're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Afghanistan Elections . AZUZ: If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, then a runoff election will be held. That is what it says in Afghanistan's constitution, and that's why the country could be looking at the runoff scenario. Unofficial results from August's election showed that the current President Hamid Karzai with 54 percent of the vote. But the Afghan Electoral Complaints Commission threw out ballots because of fraud. And when an independent group checked the final tally, it found that President Karzai only had 48 percent of the vote. The only group that can order a runoff: the Independent Election Commission.  There was no immediate reaction from them yesterday. The situation isn't just affecting Afghans. It could impact U.S. troops, as well. President Obama is reviewing a military request to send 40,000 additional forces to Afghanistan. But on Sunday, a White House official said it would be "reckless" to deploy more troops without knowing what kind of government Afghanistan's going to have. The service members who are there are battling the Taliban and the al Qaeda terrorist group. But as Atia Abawi explains, those aren't the only enemies facing U.S. forces. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ATIA ABAWI, CNN CORRESPONDENT, KABUL: Coalition forces are fighting fierce enemies in Afghanistan, facing daily attacks by different groups with differing ideologies. And contrary to popular belief, it's more than just the Taliban and al Qaeda. Captain Richard Vickery's job is to help distinguish the various groups pitted against the coalition: . CAPTAIN RICHARD VICKERY, U.S. AIR FORCE: The biggest issue that you are dealing with when you're dealing with the different insurgent groups is that they all have different motivations for wanting to fight. And that causes where we have a lot of problems with how we engage them. Are they groups that we can engage and have them cease and desist through peaceful means? Are they groups that we have to engage kinetically? ABAWI: This map shows the greatest areas of concern. In the west of the country, the insurgent groups entail more of a criminal element, some with ties to the drug trade. In southern Afghanistan you see the traditional Taliban, a group that Mullah Omar still has some influence over. The groups and alliances become more complicated as you move east. In southeastern Afghanistan bordering Pakistan, the dominant militants are from the Haqqani group headed by Jalaludin Haqqani; it's an outfit more inclined than others to use suicide attacks. In the northeast, among the many groups is another major player: Gulbideen Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizbi-Islami-Gulbideen, more commonly known as HIG. And many of these groups have cross-border ties with Pakistan. They are funded mainly by elements within Persian Gulf countries. PROFESSOR NASRULLAH STANAKZAI, UNIVERSITY OF KABUL [TRANSLATED]: These are the most dangerous fighters because they have the foreign connections with their strong ideologies and refuse to make peace with democracy, liberalism and freedom. ABAWI: Professor Stanakzai believes that there are groups and militant fighters that can be reconciled, but many will continue to use Afghanistan as their ideological battlefield. And as long as Afghanistan remains poor and undeveloped, these groups are likely to have a strong sway over the population for some time to come. Atia Abawi, CNN, Kabul. (END VIDEO CLIP) H1N1 Vaccine Delayed . AZUZ: Are you and your parents considering whether or not to get the H1N1 flu vaccine? You might have some more time to decide. Some deliveries of the shot are going to be delayed. Officials say that is because production of the vaccine is taking longer than they had hoped. About 40 million doses were expected to be ready by the end of this month. Now, it looks like that number will be closer to 30 million. As of yesterday, 11 and a half million doses were available. About eight million of those had been ordered. Health Care Talks . AZUZ: And in Washington, D.C. the debate over health care reform has moved behind closed doors, at least for a while. That's where lawmakers are working to combine different versions of health care bills passed by two separate committees, into this one single bill that will be presented to the entire Senate. That could be ready by later this week. Iran Nuclear Program . AZUZ: And U.S. officials involved in another set of talks taking place in Austria. This one is about the future of Iran's nuclear program. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who's hosting the meeting, said it got off to a good start yesterday. Participants talked about how nuclear materials made in Iran would be sent to other countries for further development and then sent back to Iran to be used in medical facilities. The hope in all of that is that the materials would only be suitable for medicine, not weapons. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The state of Louisiana doesn't have counties. This one's true. Louisiana's local government districts are referred to as parishes, not counties. Racial Controversy . AZUZ: Keith Bardwell, a judge in Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish, has caused a national controversy after he refused to marry an interracial couple. The National Urban League calls that "a huge step backward in social justice." And the newlyweds, Beth and Terence McKay, who were married by a different judge in the parish, are fighting to have Judge Bardwell dismissed from his job. Bardwell insists he is not a racist and says he's performed marriages for black couples in his house. However, he doesn't perform interracial marriages because he believes most of them don't last, and he says he's concerned about the couples' children. Bardwell says he has no regrets about his decision, since it's "hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong." Cyber Crime Concerns . AZUZ: Social networking sites let us connect with friends, but they can also potentially connect us with criminals. According to the FBI, popular sites like Facebook and Twitter are also popular among cyber thieves. Last year, the Internet Crime Complaint Center got more than 72,000 complaints about Internet fraud involving more than $260 million in losses. How does that happen? You click on what looks like an innocent link or video, or you answer an online request for money from a friend stuck somewhere overseas. Once thieves have access to your account, they can run the same scams on people who are connected to you. Some simple ways to protect yourself: Read up on sites' security policies, be careful what you click on, and change your password regularly. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! About how many U.S. students ride the bus to school every day? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it around: A) 12 million, B) 24 million, C) 36 million or D) 48 million? You've got three seconds -- GO! Approximately 24 million students take the bus to school. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! School Bus Safety . AZUZ: By now, most of you have probably seen the effects of this global recession in your schools. There may be fewer field trips, less money for activities, fewer bus routes. We blogged about that awhile back, and some of you argued that it's dangerous to walk to school, or that you couldn't get to school without the bus. It's something a lot of us take for granted. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: They're big. They're yellow. The sound of their engines is the last thing students want to hear when they're not ready for school. One question during National School Bus Safety week is are they safe? According to the Committee on School Transportation Safety and the National Research Council, yes, especially when compared to cars. There are 800 students killed every year going to and from school. 98 percent of those deaths involve passenger cars, bikes, motorcycles, pedestrian incidents. Only two percent involve school buses. The problem with buses is... ROBIN LEEDS, NATIONAL SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION: We're seeing a lot of school districts cutting back on their transportation because their budgets are tight and they're looking for ways to save money. AZUZ: So, what can be done about that? LEEDS: If parents get up in arms and say we can't afford to let our children face the kind of risks they have to face when they don't have school buses, then the school board will make the decision that they'll keep the buses. AZUZ: Beyond that, Robin Leeds of the National School Transportation Association suggests contacting state lawmakers, because many local school districts get budget money from state legislatures. If elected officials realize how important bus funding is to voters, they're less likely to eliminate bus routes. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Veterans Day is just around the corner, and we want to give you a chance to take part right here. Send us an iReport giving a shoutout to someone who's served in the Armed Forces, and you might see yourself on our show. If you want your own Shoutout, have your teacher send in an iReport with a photo of your school. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, it's about time to go pumpkin picking. That one didn't make it. But no one in the crowd is disappointed. That's because they're all here to watch these pumpkins plummet. It's actually part of a science lesson for students in West Virginia. The whole point is to plunge the pumpkins off the roof and see just how far the guts of the gourds go when they fall. Goodbye . AZUZ: Based on the reaction of the crowd, the event was a smashing success. You guys have a great day. we'll see you tomorrow, I'm Carl Azuz.</div></td></tr><tr>

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN) -- As tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, have bubbled, one official after another has taken the lead, grappling to figure out how to stop it from coming to a boil. First, it was the police chief who took charge and stumbled. Then, the governor entered the picture and brought on a Ferguson son to head security. The feds have also stepped in, with Attorney General Eric Holder stopping by Wednesday to check up on their investigation. Here's a look at the players who have shaped the city's response to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer. WHO: . Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson . What he did: . From the start the chief said his department -- which handed off the local investigation to St. Louis County -- would release information as it received it. It would be a slow process, he warned. How it played out: . From the beginning the chief was slammed for just how slow that information came out. The big one was the identity of the officer. It took six days before the name -- Darren Wilson -- was revealed. Cops said it was because he received death threats. Critics denounced the delay as a PR stumble that coincided with another one -- the release of a video that police said showed Brown robbing a store minutes before he was shot. Critics lambasted the disclosure of the video as character assassination. The chief said he had to do it. Jackson was also criticized for his department's response to the protests in the days immediately after Brown's death. As the demonstrations grew more heated, police used on the crowd tear gas, pepper bullets and what looked like stun grenades. Some police rolled into action sitting on an armored personnel carrier. How it was received: . "You're in trouble when your SWAT team is on the front line of dealing with a civil disturbance," said retired Lt. Gen. Russell HonorÃ©, a CNN analyst. Jackson said police had to protect themselves and that some of the protesters were throwing fire bombs. WHO: . Ferguson Mayor James Knowles . What he did: . The young mayor has tried to tell people unfamiliar with the town he has lived in his whole life that it's not the crucible of racial tensions it appears to be to those outside the city limits. "I've lived here 35 years. There's always been a strong African-American presence," he told CNN. "We've never seen this kind of violence, never seen this kind of frustration or tension between the races." How it played out: . The mayor has kept largely out of the spotlight, letting other officials take care of news conferences and major public appearances. Instead he's gone on one-on-one interviews and given updates on how his town reacted. How it was received: . His low profile may be helping him to avert criticism over actions taken since Brown's shooting, but Knowles has been in the line of fire with other officials over the disproportionate number of white officers on the police force of his majority African-American town. He has defended the imbalance, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that every time a position frees up for a new officer that the city rushes out to find an African-American to fill it. Ferguson is less successful at getting such recruits than neighboring departments, which are better at recruiting and offer higher salaries, he said. He has also come under criticism for a racial imbalance in the city council, where five of six members are white. Knowles, first elected in 2011, told the Post-Dispatch that he ran for election unopposed. WHO: . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon . What he did: . First he stayed out things, and when he did go, he visited the neighboring town of Florissant, not Ferguson. Then he made the decision to bring in the highway patrol. How it played out: . Poorly. The violent protests were getting more violent and police were drawing more criticism for its tactics. And the media, local and national, was asking: Where's the governor? The Washington Post wrote: "A week ago, Jay Nixon was a Democratic governor with a promising political future. Today, he's a guy with a rocky recent past." Once Nixon stepped into the fray, he didn't go to the shooting scene and was accused of avoiding ground zero. How it was received: . Attendees interjected at a meeting Nixon held at a local church to announce a controversial curfew. They demanded he charge Wilson with murder. They accused law enforcement of triggering nightly violence with militaristic tactics. WHO: . Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson . What he did: . When it seemed like the situation in Ferguson was doomed to grow out of control, the governor wrested oversight of the security force and gave it to Johnson, a Ferguson native. And at first it seemed the captain had turned the tide. He walked with protesters, turned a news conference into a community forum, seemed like a good guy who was a bridge between community and government. On Sunday, Johnson appeared at a church rally in support of the Johnson family. With a solemn and pained expression, he said he was sorry to the parents, and he explained that he, too, was the father of a black son who wears saggy pants and has tattoos. "My baby," he called his boy. How it played out: . Johnson has been open with the public as he has been trying to calm the uneasiness in the air. And even as tension still permeates the town, residents feel a little better because they know the captain will be out there. He's one of them, and they can ask him their questions. How it was received: . Well -- except for minor hiccups. Johnson was welcomed with open arms last week. But security forces under his command have lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at rowdy protesters, who toss rocks and Molotov cocktails at them. That may have soured some of the initial sentiments. CNN's Jake Tapper echoed the frustrations of many. "Absolutely there have been looters, absolutely over the last nine days there has been violence, but there is nothing going on in this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram (Afghanistan). Nothing." WHO: . Attorney Malik Shabazz . What he did: . He's the national president and founder of Black Lawyers for Justice. He has been trying to help the community stay away from rowdy elements, who he says are not from Ferguson. He told CNN on Tuesday that he came to Ferguson as a "man and a father figure." He felt confident that he and others could have a good influence on young men. How it played out: . Shabazz insists "provocateurs" from outside the community have caused the problems. He accused them of being planted in the crowd to make demonstrators look bad and turn public opinion in favor of the police. "We can't allow this movement to be destroyed," he said. On Monday, when rocks and tear gas canisters flew, he was out with a bullhorn urging people to keep calm. How it was received: . Despite Shabazz' efforts on behalf of Ferguson protesters, he has a very controversial past. The former leader of the New Black Panther Party is a black supremacist, with a history of anti-Semitic remarks, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that guards the rights of minorities and monitors hate groups. Shabazz has often railed against white people, calling them inherently evil, the SPLC said. WHO: . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder . What he did: . The first black U.S. attorney general will visit Ferguson on Wednesday. He's checking up on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into the shooting. He said he'll also meet with community leaders. The FBI has about 40 investigators in Ferguson, Holder wrote in a letter to the people of Ferguson. He says: "We hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm" to the city. How it's playing out: . Holder wrote that the investigation had already made good progress, but indicated it was not going to wrap up anytime soon. How it's being received: . It's hard to tell yet. In civil rights issues, he is considered President Barack Obama's ambassador. Some people get nervous when they see him coming. Under Holder, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years. That's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years. WHO: . St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch . What he did: . He's been the county's top prosecutor since 1991 and has been easily re-elected five times. This year, he actually had a challenger in his primary, which he handily won just a few days before Brown was killed. After Gov. Nixon replaced the St. Louis County Police with the Missouri State Highway Patrol for security last week, McCulloch said the initial law enforcement response to the shooting was excessive. McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that the governor had "no legal authority" to make such a move. How it's playing out: . McCulloch steps before a grand jury Wednesday with the assignment of making his case against Wilson. He has eyewitness accounts of Brown's shooting as well as Wilson's own account of what happened. Beyond that, much of the evidence is not yet ready, and a CNN legal analyst said it could take a long time for crime labs to process it. How it's being received: . Critics have said he could be biased in favor of the man he is tasked with prosecuting. He's the son of a cop who was killed at work 50 years ago. His mother was a clerk for the St. Louis Police Department, and three relatives were also with SLMPD. He would have been an officer too, but cancer took one of his legs. Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed and 26,000 other people have signed a petition calling for McCulloch to be removed from the case -- and a special prosecutor assigned. Governor Nixon has refused to do so.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A grinning, chuckling Kathleen Sebelius stood alongside President Barack Obama on Friday morning, accepting praise that has eluded her throughout Obamacare's troubled early months. Only 10 days ago, the president ignored her as he took a victory lap when the Affordable Care Act's signup numbers crested above 7 million. But he had kind words for the health insurance warrior in her final public appearance as a federal government employee. She told him 'in early March' that she would leave shortly after the April 1 insurance open-enrollment deadline. But on March 31, she told The Huffington Post that she would remain on the job until November. Now that she's no longer Obama's ham-fisted insurance surrogate, plagued with 'oops' moments in one congressional hearing after another, it's smiles all around. Sebelius and her team 'got the job done' with Obamacare, he said of the manager who bungled the most ambitious health initiative in U.S. history, and 'the final score speaks for itself.' Scroll down for video . Suddenly friendly: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius accepted congratulations from the president and vice president during her final White House appearance, although Obama snubbed her last week when Obamacare enrollment numbers looked promising for the first time . New HHS Secretary nominee Syliva Burwell, who now heads the Office of Management and Budget, beamed as she accepted praise from the boss and applause from a partisan crowd . On Friday Sebelius called her job helming HHS 'the opportunity of a lifetime.' The president praised her for 'five years of extraordinary service to our country.' 'I will miss her advice, I will miss her friendship, I will miss her wit,' he said. Even her farewell speech had its panic moment. 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said before improvising the end of her remarks. Obama's well-wishes included moments of Obamacare crescendo, but equal time for other liberal identity-politics totems. She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the ACA,' Obama said. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough.' But Sebelius, Obama said, had also 'reduced racial and ethnic disparities' in Americans' well-being, and was 'a tireless advocate for women's health.' Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, was nominated to take her place. Obama appeared with the outgoing and incoming HHS secretaries in the White House Rose Garden, shortly before jetting off for fundraisers, and a speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, in New York City. Sebelius' replacement is Sylvia . Mathews Burwell, a long-time Democratic operative whose political career . has come in two acts with a lengthy intermission. Burwell . served in the Clinton White House as deputy to then-budget director . Jack Lew, who would later become Obama's treasury secretary. She was . briefly ensnared in an investigation into the suicide death of Deputy . White House counsel Vince Foster. As . Secret Service agents scoured Foster's office for clues about why he . took his life, Burwell briefly sifted through a 'burn bag' containing . classified documents that she wasn't supposed to see. After . a stint as deputy chief of staff during the Monica Lewinsky crisis, she . went to the private sector, first at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and later at the top of the Walmart foundation, the . mega-retail chain's charitable arm – only to succumb again to . Washington's lure. The U.S. Senate confirmed her last year to run OMB, by a 96-0 margin. Oops! 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said, skipping a portion of her speech in the final cock-up of her time at HHS . Lean forward: Obama hopes to wipe the Obamacare slate clean with a new quarterback, but Senate Republicans will likely turn her confirmation hearing into an license to fish for new information about the unpopular policy . The timing of Sebelius' departure was designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor, coming just a week after Obama announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco. Obama brought past and future HHS secretaries to a Rose Garden event attended by officials including Shaun Donovan, Gina McCarthy, Anthony Foxx, Tom Vilsack, John Kerry, Valerie Jarrett, Jeff Zients, Tina Tchen and Shailagh Murray . She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the Affordable Care Act,' Obama gushed. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough. She's got bumps. I've got bumps, and bruises.' The White House aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president's flagship policy. Republicans were quick to pounce Thursday, confounding those hopes. 'Kathleen Sebelius had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as Obamacare,' House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa said in a statement. 'Her tenure as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services may be at an end, but Americans will be dealing with the repercussions of the president's health law for a very long time.' On the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, minority leader Mitch McConnell called it 'fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of Obamacare predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning.' 'Regardless of the administration’s public explanation for the Secretary’s exit, Obamacare has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of Americans who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families.' The train-wreck reference was a nod to former Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, now Obama's ambassador to China, who warned Sebelius on April 17, 2013 that the Affordable Care Act was headed for the rocks. 'I just see a huge train wreck coming down," he said then. 'You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet.' Dela vu: 13 months ago Obama introduced Sylvia Burwell in the East Room of the White House as him new budget director . The Affordable Care Act has been fraught . with trouble since its official rollout in October. Its website . crashed, cost estimates quickly rose, and public dissatisfaction has . dogged the initiative for more than two years. The . October 1 online unveiling was nothing short of disastrous, with even . liberal commentators and Democrats in Congress conceding that the . government's effort was not ready for prime time. Contractors' efforts . were incompatible, data servers were inadequate, and payment systems . linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day. Kathleen Sebelius joined the Obama administration in April 2009 as a figure unknown to Americans in 49 states. She had been  governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and that state;s insurance commissioner for eight years before that. Her only national platform prior to Obama's election came in 2008 when, as a former chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she was tapped to deliver her party's response to President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address. She wasn't expected to play a role in the new administration until former Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota politician who had once been Senate Majority Leader, withdrew his candidacy for the top HHS job following a tax scandal. He had failed to pay taxes on more than $83,000 in earnings in 2007, and claimed tax deductions for nearly $15,000 of donations to charities that didn't meet the IRS's tax-deductibility standards. Sebelius hasn't said where she will go after she leaves the president's cabinet. Her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner (Tommy Thompson), a university professor (Donna Shalala) and a think-tank chief (Mike Leavitt). None of them, however, presided over a program that, like Obamacare, was controversial, partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning. Sebelius . presided over all of it, producing misgivings across the U.S. capital . that she was up to the task. She has, however, been the administration's . designated spear-catcher, attracting slings and arrows from both houses . of Congress and the public at every turn. The . president raised eyebrows nationwide on April 1 when he failed to . acknowledge her contribution to the program's recent . momentum during a high-profile Rose Garden victory speech. Sebelius, who has served in Obama's cabinet for five years, was not there alongside him but sat, unnoticed, in the front row. As the White House shifted from shame to fist-pumping, Sebelius continued to attract scorn. She said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that more . than 7.5 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through the . Obamacare system. She could not, however, answer a question from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch about how many subscribers were . uninsured before the law took effect. Additionally, . she hasn't provided Congress with answers about how many Obamacare enrollees have paid premiums, a . necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans. A recent McKinsey and Company study estimated that no more than 1 million Americans both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system. Although Democrats will likely have more than enough votes to confirm Burwell as HHS secretary, more than a half-dozen liberals facing difficult re-election fights will be forced to moderate their enthusiasm. Public hearings could become a spectacle of Republicans demanding internal documents and the White House claiming executive privilege. At the least, the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives' objections to Obama's new insurance model. 'The president doesn't need more Obamacare controversy so close to November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline shortly after the announcement of Sebelius' departure. 'And if Republicans object too much to Burwell, the Democrats will trot out the "war on women" narrative even more. We don't need that in an election year.'</div></td></tr><tr>

As the new Bundesliga season begins, German football has probably never been in such rude health. When Bayern Munich start the defence of their title against Wolfsburg on Friday night, 40 days will have elapsed since Philipp Lahm lifted the World Cup trophy in the Maracana and their time in the international wilderness is most certainly over. Blessed with a 'golden generation' of wonderfully-gifted players all blossoming at the same time, Germany swept all beside them to win the tournament for a fourth time and few would argue they were undeserved winners. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bayern can cope with injuries - Breitner . All-time high: German football has never been stronger following the national team's World Cup triumph . The ones to beat: Bayern Munich will once again be the strong favourites for the Bundesliga title, lifted here by their captain Philipp Lahm at the end of last season. They also won the DFB-Pokal to complete the double . Even stronger: Bayern have boosted their firepower further by signing Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski . VIDEO Bayern can cope with injuries - Breitner . Their triumph could also signal the start of a period of dominance similar to that of Spain over the last few years, with young talents coming through all the time and coach Joachim Low adept at helping them along. Domestically, the Germans also seem to have got everything spot on as well. The Bundesliga continues to draw the biggest average attendances and has by popular consensus the best experience for the fans with cheap tickets and safe standing. It can also claim to be the most entertaining - with an average of 3.16 goals per game over the last 12 years, compared to 2.77 in the Premier League - and the best run, making a profit year-on-year and successfully restricting ruinous debt and short-term profit hunting with the '50+1' rule. These figures will only continue to improve as the fans flock to see Germany's World Cup stars who, on the whole, will be playing in the league next season. It's all very positive but one question remains - who can stop Bayern Munich? Unique experience: German grounds, such as Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, are noted for their atmosphere . Unstoppable: Thomas Muller scored 26 goals last season and five more for Germany at the World Cup . Happy man: Pep Guardiola guided Bayern to the domestic double in his first season at the Allianz Arena . FRIDAY . Bayern Munich vs Wolfsburg (19.30) Live on BT Sport 1 . SATURDAY (14.30 unless stated) Cologne vs Hamburg . Eintracht Frankfurt vs Freiburg . Hannover 96 vs Schalke 04 . Hertha Berlin vs Werder Bremen . Hoffenheim vs Augsburg . Borussia Dortmund vs Bayer Leverkusen (17.30) Live on BT Sport 1 . SUNDAY . Paderborn vs Mainz (14.30) Borussia Monchengladbach vs Stuttgart (16.30) Both live on BT Sport 1 . The Bavarians sent records tumbling as they retained their title last season, wrapping things up with seven matches remaining on March 25 and going on to finish 19 points clear of distant challengers Borussia Dortmund. They set league records for the most wins in a row (19), the best goal difference away from home (+38) and the longest undefeated streak (53 games going back into the season before). And after all that, they then acquired Robert Lewandowski, the league's top goalscorer and arguably the best player of their closest challengers. Toni Kroos may have been sold to Real Madrid, but Bayern still boast World Cup heroes Manuel Neuer, Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze and Jerome Boateng. With the likes of Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and Javi Martinez also in there, all the signs point to another Bayern procession. It's an issue I raised with the league's chief executive Christian Seifert prior to the Super Cup final in Dortmund last week. He said Bayern's dominance would only concern him if it lasted for five years or more, admitting that a situation akin to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership would 'not be so good for us.' But he believed the situation will change given time and the right system is in place to ensure other teams can challenge for the Bundesliga title. Dortmund are best equipped and they struck an early blow when they beat a misfiring Bayern side 2-0 in the Super Cup curtain-raiser. First strike: Borussia Dortmund lifted the German Super Cup last week, beating Bayern Munich . Playing catch up: Can Dortmund's popular manager Jurgen Klopp lead a sustained challenge for the title? But then again, Jurgen Klopp's side won the same fixture 12 months ago and went on to trail by some distance, so take it with a pinch of salt. Starting with Saturday's match with Bayer Leverkusen, they must hit the ground running. Any slip will prove costly but Bayern will be without some of their World Cup stars for the first few weeks, perhaps allowing the opportunity to build a handy little lead. 'At the moment I have only eight or nine players who are fully fit,' said Pep Guardiola last week, with Martinez and Schweinsteiger among the long-term absentees. Franck Ribery and Thiago Alcantara will also miss the start. Lewandowski's departure hardly came as a surprise and Dortmund hope new buys Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos will be sufficient to make up the 28 goals scored by the Pole last season. Missing the start: Bastian Schweinsteiger will be out for a while yet with a knee injury . New signing: Dortmund have brought in Ciro Immobile from Torino to fill the gap left by Lewandowski . Positive start: Adrian Ramos (right) celebrates scoring with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 4-1 DFB-Pokal win over Stuttgart Kickers at the weekend . Immobile was certainly impressive last season as his 22 goals in Serie A helped Torino into the Europa League, while Colombian Ramos scored 16 in 34 games for Hertha Berlin. Klopp will also be encouraged that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are already hitting form, having both scored in the Super Cup and the DFB-Pokal victory at Stuttgart Kickers last weekend. He also has Marco Reus, who missed the World Cup with an ankle injury, Neven Subotic, who missed the bulk of last season with ligament damage, and Ilkay Gundogan, who has missed a whole year with a back injury, to return. But even when back to full strength, Dortmund will have to be outstanding to keep up with their title rivals. In form: Armenian striker Henrikh Mkhitaryan has scored in the Super Cup and the opening DFB-Pokal tie . Look who's back: Marco Reus has returned from the ankle injury that kept him out of the World Cup . It's hard to see beyond those two for the title, leaving the likes of Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach to challenge for the Champions League places. Young manager Jens Keller is starting to make his mark at Schalke and the acquisition of Germany international Sidney Sam from Leverkusen, sealed back in January, represents a coup. Cameroon winger Eric Choupo-Moting, who scored 10 goals last season, has joined from Mainz on a free transfer and, with the likes of Julian Draxler, Kevin Prince Boateng and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the team, they should be able to mount a challenge, especially if they avoid a slow start like last year. New boy: Schalke have signed Germany international Sidney Sam from Bayer Leverkusen . Main man: Schalke will depend heavily on the goals of Dutchman Klass-Jan Huntelaar . Leverkusen, who are desperate to end a 21-year trophy drought and finally shake off the 'Neverkusen' tag, have again raided Hamburg for their summer shopping. A year after South Korean star Son Heung-Min made the switch, Bayer have signed talented Turk Hakan Calhanoglu for £12m. He's the guy who scored that outrageous 50-yard free-kick against Dortmund last season, one of 11 he got last season. Another new recruit is £6m Swiss striker Josip Drmic from relegated Nuremberg and new coach Roger Schmidt will hope he can combine well with Stefan Kiessling. The job represents a step-up for Schmidt, who led Red Bull Salzburg to the Austrian league and cup double last season. Exciting: Bayer Leverkusen splashed out £12m to sign Hamburg's Hakan Calhanoglu this summer . Wolfsburg missed out on Champions League qualification by a single point last season and moved to sign Werder Bremen's playmaker Aaron Hunt as well as Arsenal's much-maligned striker Nicklas Bendtner. The Volkswagen-owned club also have former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne and Brazilian Luiz Gustavo in their ranks, plus they've borrowed highly-regarded Frenchman Joshua Guilavogui from Atletico Madrid. Fresh start: Nicklas Bendtner has joined Champions League challengers Wolfsburg from Arsenal . There is every chance they will push for the Champions League places, as will Monchengladbach, for whom striker Max Kruse will be key. They lost Marc-Andre ter Stegen to Barcelona but spent £7m on Basle's Yann Sommer to fill the gloves. Chelsea youngster Thorgan Hazard, younger brother of Eden, will spent the season on loan at Borussia-Park. Things surely have to go better for Hamburg, who survived a relegation play-off to preserve their Bundesliga ever-present status back in May. Striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, the man who scored the vital goal against Greuther Furth that kept them up, has been signed on a permanent basis from Hertha and will hopefully offer the goals to propel them a little further up the table. Coming into the top flight are 'yo-yo club' Cologne and Paderborn, who are at this level for the first time.

Hundreds today used their Bank Holiday Monday to pay tribute to murdered soldier Lee Rigby by laying yet more flowers, balloons and hand-written notes at the spot where he died in Woolwich. Many sobbed as they came to see the stream of tributes that now runs the whole length of the street where the 25 year old Drummer was executed as he walked to his barracks last Wednesday. Meanwhile 10 miles across London more than 1,000 English Defence League supporters waved placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and 'GB RIP', as well as singing 'There's Only One Lee Rigby', and some anti-Muslim songs as they marched in his memory. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Poignant: Flowers left at the scene where Lee Rigby, who was wearing a Help For Heroes Tshirt, was murdered by two fanatics brandishing firearms, knives and machetes . In remembrance: The number of floral tributes outside Woolwich Barricks has grown over the weekend as people pay their respects . Heartfelt: A young girl adds to the hundreds of bouquets laid at the scene in Woolwich . Respectful: Crowds add to the floral tributes to Lee Rigby. Balloons, bouquets and cards adorn the scene where he was killed last week . They snarled at United . Against Fascism supporters, with both groups largely kept apart by . police as they both protested on Whitehall, close to Downing Street. Witnesses said that both groups then began to throw dozens of glass bottles at each other. Earlier the EDL demonstrators pushed their way through a police cordon as they made their way to Trafalgar Square. They . chanted 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There’s only one Lee . Rigby' and protesters held placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and . 'GB RIP'. EDL leader Tommy Robinson told the demonstration: 'This is a day of respect for our Armed Forces.' The crowd repeatedly chanted 'coward' after he claimed Prime Minister David Cameron was on holiday 'because he doesn't care'. Mr Robinson added: 'They've had their Arab Spring. This is time for the English Spring.' Chanting: English Defence League supporters wore Union Jacks and flew England flags as they called David Cameron a 'coward' for going on holiday after the Woolwich terror attack . Making themselves heard: Defence League demonstrators chant anti-Muslim messages during a protest in the sunshine in Whitehall . Faces of fury: Protestors with the English Defence League gathered outside Downing Street. Leaders said the protest was a celebration of the armed Forces . Aggression: Police had prepared for an aggressive protest following the shoicking killing of British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last Wednesday . A . group of United Against Fascism supporters staged a . counter-protest at the same time and were penned in by the Met Police to . avoid ugly clashes. Violence broke out when about 100 anti-fascists mobbed five protestors who were arriving to join the march draped in Union Jacks and wearing England football shirts. Police filmed the anti-EDL protesters as they chanted 'fascist scum off our streets' and 'follow your leader, kill yourself like Adolf Hitler' before escorting the EDL supporters around Parliament Square. The demonstrators marched through . Admiralty Arch and onto Parliament Square. They were escorted by . Metropolitan Police officers and vans, while a force helicopter followed . overhead. A Scotland Yard spokesman said Whitehall was closed to traffic because of 'a number of demonstrations'. Tensions have also increased in . certain communities where thugs have been attacking mosques in . retaliation for the murder of Lee Rigby. A Grimsby mosque was last night hit with petrol bombs, while people were inside, including children. Chairman . Diler Gharib said: 'We had just finished our prayers and were . discussing how to thank our neighbours for the support they have shown . us over the past few days when we heard a bang and saw fire coming under . the door. Backlash: A counter-protest, staged by United against Fasciam, led to violence when 100 anti-fascists mobbed protestors who were joining the EDL march .

'I grabbed a . fire extinguisher and put it out and then two more petrol bombs hit the . fire escape and the bin so I had to put those out too. 'Luckily . the police have been monitoring the mosque since the last attack and . they were able to arrest two people almost straight away. 'We . have all been feeling on edge and now this has happened. It’s not just . the people at the mosque we are worried about, it’s our wives, daughters . and children who are out in the community. 'People . need to realise that the people who committed the murder in Woolwich . are criminals and it had nothing to do with the Muslim faith.' Two men, aged 33 and 37, have been arrested after yesterday's attack and are still in police custody. Four boys, aged 15 and 16, were arrested after a separate attack on Thursday and were released on bail until the end of June. Chief . Supt Tony Forbes said today: 'I would like to remind people that these . are serious offences which are being investigated and those who are . responsible will be brought to justice. 'It is important to remember that . those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority . and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North . East Lincolnshire. 'The . people who want to engage themselves in this type of criminal activity . will be dealt with using all appropriate police resources and powers. Control: Police officers walk members of the English Defence League protest as they march from Trafalgar Square . Standing guard: Police cordoned protestors off today, in an attempt to keep the protest peaceful . On the run: Police officers move into position as they react to English Defence League members marching . Should David Cameron have gone on holiday as Britain deals with terror crisis? 'I . have spoken to community leaders and what is clear to me is the attacks . will not be allowed to undermine the very good community relations in . North East Lincolnshire. 'My officers will continue to work with all of our communities to protect them and ensure their safety.' On Saturday night riot police were called to stop a ‘Help for Heroes’ walk over fears it would turn violent. Officers carrying shields and batons brought a halt to the parade in Bristol after they received reports of planned trouble. Marchers . said they were raising money for the armed forces charity but internet . rumours claimed  facist group the English Defence League was also . taking part. Police stopped the walk outside a pub - sparking a five hour stand-off which saw up to 40 people barricade themselves inside. Riot police, vans and horses attended on Saturday evening as an operation was launched to contain the group. Scotland Yard said three arrests had been made during the protest and counter-protest outside Downing Street. EDL members congregated after their march in Leicester Square, central London. As one youth was taken away by police, the crowd began throwing bottles at them. One . officer was hit on the head with a glass bottle and the mob followed . the officers, chanting "who the f*** is Allah?" before being pushed back . towards the square. Skirmishes . broke out around the square, with several men threatening a youth . wearing a Palestinian scarf with a stick before police intervened. As . the two groups arrived towards Westminster Tube station, the . anti-fascists began to run towards the men, forcing the police to set up . a cordon to protect them. Officers say there were 19 arrests and 12 people were later charged with public order offences and five remanded in custody. Meanwhile an English Defence . League activist who threatened to burn down a mosque in retaliation for . Lee Rigby's murder has been told he faces jail. Adam . Rodgers took to Facebook following the murder and called on his fellow . EDL members to meet him at a mosque in Hastings, Sussex. Attack: This scorched door to the Grimsby Mosque shows the damage caused by the firebomb attack last night . Upsetting: The spray paint has been used to scrub out the inscription on the tribute to the animals which helped keep Britain free . Attack: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was also targeted in the past 24 hours and was then covered in black plastic and guarded by police . A tarpaulin covers part of the Animals in War Memorial on Park Lane, which police say they found at 5am on Monday . The . 28-year-old posted various 'inflammatory' remarks on the social . networking site in the hours following the drummer's death including . 'the mosque needs burning down'. Lead . magistrate Paul Brown, told him: 'The harm you could have created was . potentially huge due to the circumstances. 'You made threats to burn down . a mosque and mobilise people at a time when feelings are running very . high due to a tragic incident. All options will remain open, including . prison.' Two . of Britain's most celebrated war memorials have been defaced, . apparently with the word 'Islam' scrawled across them and inscriptions . scrubbed out with red paint. Police have confirmed they are . investigating the vandalism of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in Green . Park and the Animals In War Memorial in Park Lane, both in central . London. Pictures taken today show that the damage has now been covered over with plastic or white sheets. Scotland Yard said there have not been . any arrests, so it not clear if it has been done by Muslim protesters or far-right . groups attempting to stir-up hatred. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'At 5am this morning police discovered graffiti on both the RAF Bomber . Command War Memorial in Green Park and the Animals in War Memorial on . Park Lane. Scene: Police and firefighters attend the blaze started by troublemakers at a Grimsby mosque last night . Problems: Hoards of police were forced to break up the walk in Bristol because of disorder . Trouble: Riot officers were called to halt a Bristol walk in support of Help for Heroes after they feared it would stoke up 'community tensions' - this led to 19 arrests . 'Royal Parks' officers and Westminster police are investigating. There have been no arrests at present.' The Bomber Command Memorial remembers . the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives . in the Second World War and was unveiled by the Queen last summer. Just . last week Dame Judi Dench described herself as being 'very proud' to be . the first patron of a new campaign to preserve it for generations to . come. The . Animals in War Memorial is 'a powerful and moving tribute to all the . animals that served, suffered and died alongside the British, . Commonwealth and Allied forces in the wars and conflicts of the 20th . century', according to the Animals in War Fund website. The monument was unveiled by the Princess Royal in November 2004 - the 90th anniversary of the start of World War I. The . fund's website says the £2 million needed to build the monument came . from 'a national appeal and the generosity of many individual donors, . charities and companies'.</div></td></tr><tr>

UPDATED: . 11:41 EST, 29 August 2013 . The UK could launch a military strike against Syria without the support of the United Nations, government legal advice released today claims. Downing Street published the official legal position suggesting Britain would not breach international law if it launched ‘military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting’ further use of chemical weapons. And the government released an intelligence report – likened to the so-called Iraq dodgy dossier – which claimed it is ‘highly likely’ that the Syrian regime was responsible for a chemical attack in Damascus on August 21. Scroll down for video <!-- br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --> . Legal advice: Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Downing Street for the Commons debate on Syria . David Cameron had hoped to secure the backing of the House of Commons for imminent military action in a crunch vote tonight. But Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to back the government, setting seven different conditions which would need to be met before the opposition would support an air strike. MPs have been recalled to Parliament to debate the UK response to the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people. Mr Miliband wants the government to pursue any action through the United Nations, but both Russia and China have vowed to veto any UN resolution backing military action. Ahead of this afternoon’s debate, Number 10 released its legal position insisting Britain could legally go it alone and support the United States in a targeted strike to act as a deterrent for future use of chemical weapons. Justifiable: The two-page legal position insists . Britain could carry out a targeted military strike against Syria . without securing a UN resolution . The legal advice states: ‘Previous . attempts by the UK and its international partners to secure a resolution . of this conflict, end its associated humanitarian suffering and prevent . the use of chemical weapons through meaningful action by the Security . Council have been blocked over the last two years.' It argues that if Russia and China continue to block action through the UN Security Council there would be 'no practicable alternative' to the use of force to 'deter and degrade the capacity for the further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime'. It adds: ‘In these circumstances, and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable. ‘Such an intervention would be directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe, and the minimum judged necessary for that purpose.’ As the main party leaders briefed . their MPs on their return to Westminster for the emergency recall of . Parliament, six RAF Typhoon jets were deployed to Cyprus to protect UK . interests and sovereign bases. The . Prime Minister yesterday battled desperately to get a consensus for a . missile attack, but was forced by Mr Miliband and Tory rebels to allow . UN inspectors time to report on last week’s chemical weapons atrocity. Top brass: Chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton (L) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond arrive for a cabinet meeting at Number 10 . Cabinet: International Development Secretary . Justine Greening, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Home Secretary . Theresa May were briefed on the latest developments in Number 10 today . But a three page dossier from the Joint Intelligence Committee made clear that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack last week in which 350 died. The JIC found there are 'no plausible alternative scenarios to Assad's regime being behind the attack and has given the Prime Minister full access to 'highly sensitive' intelligence. It could not, however, come up with a 'precise motivation' for the attack. It concludes: ‘It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a chemical weapons attack on this scale. ‘The regime has used chemical weapons on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. ‘There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible.’ Cabinet ministers were briefed on the latest intelligence this morning, ahead of the Commons debate. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The judgment of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that a chemical weapons attack did occur in Damascus last week; that it is highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible; that there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability; and that no opposition group has the capability to conduct a chemical weapons attack on this scale. ‘Ministers agreed that it is fundamentally in our national interest to uphold the longstanding convention on chemical weapons and to make clear that they cannot be used with impunity. ‘Any response should be legal, proportionate and specifically in response to this attack and everyone around the Cabinet table agreed that it is not about taking sides in the Syrian conflict nor about trying to determine the outcome.’ Here is the full text of the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment of the Syrian chemical weapons attack, followed by a letter from Jon Day, chairman of the JIC, to the Prime Minister:JIC assessment of 27 August on Reported Chemical Weapons use in Damascus . A chemical attack occurred in Damascus on the morning of 21 August, resulting in at least 350 fatalities. It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a CW [chemical weapons] attack on this scale. The regime has used CW on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible. Extensive video footage attributed to the attack in eastern Damascus (which we assess would be very difficult to falsify) is consistent with the use of a nerve agent, such as sarin, and is not consistent with the use of blister or riot control agents. There is no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of CW on an apparently larger scale now, particularly given the current presence in Syria of the UN investigation team. Permission to authorise CW has probably been delegated by President Asad to senior regime commanders, such as [*], but any deliberate change in the scale and nature of use would require his authorisation. There is no credible evidence that any opposition group has used CW. A number continue to seek a CW capability, but none currently has the capability to conduct a CW attack on this scale. Russia claims to have a 'good degree of confidence' that the attack was an 'opposition provocation' but has announced that they support an investigation into the incident. We expect them to maintain this line. The Syrian regime has now announced that it will allow access to the sites by UN inspectors. There is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness. However, the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites, the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. From Jon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee to the Prime Minister: . SYRIA: REPORTED CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE . Following the widespread open source reports of chemical weapons (CW) use in the suburbs of Damascus in the early hours of 21 August 2013, the JIC met on 25 August to agree an assessment. At a subsequent meeting on 27 August we met again to review our level of confidence in the assessment relating to the regime's responsibility for the attack. The JIC's conclusions were agreed by all Committee members. The final paper informed the National Security Council meeting on 28 August, at which I provided further background and a summary of the most recent reporting, analysis and challenge. The paper's key judgements, based on the information and intelligence available to us as of 25 August, are attached. It is important to put these JIC judgements in context. We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW on 14 occasions from 2012. This judgement was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the Joint Intelligence Organisation of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources. We think that there have been other attacks although we do not have the same degree of confidence in the evidence. A clear pattern of regime use has therefore been established. Unlike previous attacks, the degree of open source reporting of CW use on 21 August has been considerable. As a result, there is little serious dispute that chemical attacks causing mass casualties on a larger scale than hitherto (including, we judge, at least 350 fatalities) took place. It is being claimed, including by the regime, that the attacks were either faked or undertaken by the Syrian Armed Opposition. We have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources, and invited HMG and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible. There is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition. The JIC has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility. We also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgement that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the Opposition from strategic parts of Damascus. Some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all. Against that background, the JIC concluded that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for the CW attacks on 21 August. The JIC had high confidence in all of its assessments except in relation to the regime's precise motivation for carrying out an attack of this scale at this time - though intelligence may increase our confidence in the future. There has been the closest possible cooperation with the Agencies in producing the JIC's assessment. We have also worked in concert with the US intelligence community and agree with the conclusions they have reached. Jon Day .</div></td></tr><tr>

UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 10 December 2012 . A newspaper poll in Australia has revealed that more than two-thirds of people do not blame DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha. More than 34,000 readers took part in the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper's poll, with 68 per cent saying the blame should not be apportioned to the radio presenters. It comes as the Australian press accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' in the wake of the incident. 2Day FM remained under siege today, with internet hoaxers setting up fake pages, and the hacking group Anonymous allegedly threatened the station's advertisers in a video posted on YouTube. Scroll down for video . 'Witch-hunt': The Australian press has accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' following nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death. The nurse was duped by a hoax call from radio presenters Michael Christian, left, and Mel Greig, right . Headlines: Nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death made the front pages of most of Australia's main media players today . Mother-of-two Mrs Saldanha, 46 was . found dead on Friday in staff accommodation at the hospital where Kate, . 30, had been treated for acute morning sickness. She . was one of two nurses duped into believing that two 2Day FM presenters . putting on accents were the Queen and Prince Phillip attempting to get . an update on Kate's condition. Her death made the front page . of most of Australia's biggest papers, with much of the focus falling . on Michael Christian and Mel Greig, the two young DJs at the eye of the . storm. The pair are said to be receiving counselling following Mrs Saldanha's death. A copycat page pretending to be the radio station's real website has added to problems for the company. The copycat, which is using the . station's official logo, has outraged users by asking them to vote on . whether they would commit suicide if they received a prank call. 'Comment if you would kill yourself if you got prank called and like if you wouldn't kill yourself,' said the bogus site. Many . Australian media commentators were today defending the DJs at the . centre of the controversial prank and accused the British media and . members of the public who took to Twitter and Facebook to lambast the . pair of 'witch hunt'. The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a spokeswoman for Austereo as describing the backlash in the British media as 'ferocious'. She said: 'Australia seems to be much more balanced. In the UK it's like they're on a witch-hunt. 'It's . intense and what's incredible to me is it's so much easier for the . British media to have us as the target (than the hospital).' Top story: Many Australian newspapers have focused on the prank's devastating outcome both for the nurse's family and the two DJs at the centre of the storm . Finger pointing: Many papers talked of a 'blame game' being played by UK media following the radio prank . Andrew Bolt wrote in the Herald Sun . that Grieg and Christian could potentially face the same fate as . Jacintha Saldanha as they seek 'intensive counselling' in the wake of . the nurse's death. He said: 'To be guilty of bad taste is . one thing but to be held guilty of manslaughter is a monstrously unfair . other, and makes the finger pointers seem hypocrites. 'Want to push more people over the edge? Keep on screaming "blood on their hands".' Siobhan Duck of the same newspaper called for people not to point the finger of blame at Greig and Christian. An . opinion piece written in a similar tone in the Australian Sunday . Telegraph said: 'It is profoundly unfair to load responsibility for Ms . Saldanha's death upon the shoulders of 2DayFM's young presenters. 'They could not have possibly known anything of the torment that clearly placed the mother of two at risk of self-harm.' The . paper blamed the Leveson Inquiry and a heightened awareness of ethics . among the British media as the reason behind the so-called 'blame game.' An article stated that while . accusations had been aimed at the hospital and its staff initially for . falling for the prank, the 'tide turned like a tsunami with the guilt . now aimed at the Sydney radio pair Mel Greig and Michael Christian' following Mrs Saldanha's death. The . Telegraph also pointed out that the reasons for Mrs Saldanha's apparent . suicide are unclear despite her part in the radio prank. An . article read: 'Mainstream media websites published thousands of . comments directly blaming Greig and Christian for the death. 'Both . responses are wildly out of proportion to the event. It is seductive, . but too simple, to blame Ms Saldanha's death on a radio hoax. 'Suicide is a complex act and can rarely be entirely blamed on a lone event, however distressing.' It was clear that many people were . taken in by the fake site. 'I cannot believe the radio has the balls to . post this message,' wrote one user. 'How dare them try and blame her . death on something else. I hope your station gets shut down and you lose . all your advertiser,' wrote another person who was tricked by the fake . site. A YouTube user claiming to be part of . the internet activist group Anonymous made a threat aimed at the DJs . and Rhys Holleran, chief executive officer of the company. A computer-generated . voice accompanied a vision of the Anonymous group's signature Guy . Fawkes mask. It said: 'You are directly responsible for the . death of another human being, a woman who was dedicated to helping . others, a mother who was loved, a respected member of the community who . was turned into a joke by your radio station. 'We have studied the facts and found you guilty of murder.' To add to the station's woes, shares in owners Southern Cross Media plunged by six per cent. Blame: A video purported to be from the Anonymous group condemned the two DJs . Duped: The King Edward VII hospital in central London where Kate was being treated for extreme morning sickness last week. Nurses at the hospital were duped into giving out details of her condition in a hoax call by two Australian radio presenters . Tributes: Flowers left outside the Nurse quarters to the King Edward VII hospital in London where Jacintha Saldanha died after recieving a prank phonecall from an Australian radio station . The Sydney Daily Telegraph paper charted the careers of the pair, in particular Michael Christian, who it described as a 'rising star' of Australian radio, whose life they said 'will never be the same again'. Tragic: An undated family photograph of Jacintha Saldanha, (right) the Indian-origin nurse who died after being hoaxed by an Australian radio show trying to reach Prince William's wife in London . According to the Telegraph, the pair had only just started working together when the prank call was made. Jane Hansen of the Sunday Mail was particularly sympathetic to the young pair and cited a similar journalistic experience of her own which had a profound effect on her life and career. She told how a story she ran on a television repairman charging customers for work not being carried out had killed himself following her piece. She said: 'I'm not going to sit in judgement, nor do I want to sound like an apologist. But I will say that suicide leaves everyone gutted and searching around for answers. 'There is no way such a silly prank should lead to such a tragic outcome, but the radio duo will blame themselves - and there will be plenty of haters ready to fan such thoughts.' The Sunday . Telegraph's front page headline 'Shattered' described how a 'juvenile' prank had destroyed lives on both sides of the world. The story told how Greig and Christian are in hiding and both receiving counselling following the incident. The same paper also featured the reaction of Kate Middleton's second cousin Lilian Lowers who moved to the remote New South Wales town of Gilgandra - ironically Michael Christian's home town - from Luton, Bedfordshire, in 1982 with her husband Ron. She told the paper that her sympathies lay with Mrs Saldanha's family. She said: 'It's absolutely shocking. There was no need to play that prank just for laughs. What a terrible thing to happen. 'I couldn't believe it.' The Australian described the hoax . call's consequences as a timely reminder of  the 'impact media in all . its forms can have on an individual.' One of Australia's biggest broadsheet dailies The Sydney Morning . Herald told how radio station 2Day FM were in crisis talks after . advertisers distanced themselves from the station and King Edward VII . Hospital's chairman wrote a letter to station bosses. The SMH reported that the DJ's have expressed a desire to speak to the press and publicly state their remorse. Pranksters: Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian, right, have been suspended from their 2DayFM show . The prank seems to have divided opinion in Australia. More than 83,000 of the SMH's readers . had taken part in a poll asking whether their opinion of the hoax call . had changed in light of Mrs Saldanha's death. Just 27 per cent of those polled said . that the prank was a joke and that its 'consequences were not . intended.' 61 per cent said that they always found the joke 'in bad . taste'. One reader, named only as Daveywavey . commented on the newspaper's website: 'What was ever supposed to be . funny about trying to contact a sick, pregnant woman being treated in . hospital in her first (and most dangerous) trimester when the status of . the foetus was unknown? 'Even by Australian 'larrikin' standards, I'm not seeing the humour.' But . many Australian's agreed with claims that there is a 'witch-hunt' against the two radio presenters at the heart of the scandal. Melbourne, . Australia, resident Paul Gallacher tweeted: 'How was Jacintha Saldanha . disciplined by the hospital one wonders? The prank was a long shot. Hindsight is very convenient.' Meanwhile, . Matthew Grundy, Tweeting from Victoria, Australia, said: 'British media . rather hypocritical over 2dayfm scandal considering their phone tapping . scandal. Did they hound the nurses involved?' A fellow Australian Twitter user known only as Sam added: 'No-one could . possibly have foreseen the tragic aftermath of the 2dayfm prank call, . and therefore the blame game should end.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">CIA agents were envious of the glamorous treatment given to the real-lief tenacious operative who tracked Osama bin Laden for the better part of a decade, it was revealed today. Hollywood starlet Jessica Chastain plays the undercover analyst known as Maya, the woman who eventually finds the location of the then al-Qaeda leader. She is portrayed in a glamorous light – with wardrobes full of designer clothes and an enviable figure. But the real-life ‘Maya’ didn’t have it as easy as the strawberry-blonde Chastain; despite being one of the key people responsible for bin Laden’s demise, Maya was passed over for a promotion. Scroll down for video . Jealousy? Robert Baer, left, said that the CIA was and continues to be a boy's club, left, Valerie Plame, a former CIA officer herself said that she'd love to get a drink with the real-life 'Maya' Former CIA operative Bob Baer told the ‘TODAY’ show that it was unsurprising that the female CIA operative was looked over for a promotion that would have given her an additional $16,000 per annum. ‘It’s an old-boy network,’ he explained. ‘You don’t know why people are promoted, why people are held back, and often people think the worst.’ Valerie Plame, a CIA officer whose identity was leaked, told the show that she admired the operative’s moxy. ‘I’d love to have a drink with her one day,’ she said. The Washington Post’s David Ignatius told the ‘TODAY’ show that the response from the CIA was not unusual, saying that operatives are often ‘quite contrary,’ The reality of America’s battle against terrorism couldn’t have been more different to the glamorized, politically-correct fiction of Homeland, the hit TV show in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided male colleagues have missed. CIA supersleuth: A attractive young female CIA agent, played by Jessica Chastain in the film Zero Dark Thirty, spent the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and became the SEALs' go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target . The world’s most dangerous terror group foiled by a killer blonde in Calvin Klein who wars with her superiors? Only in Hollywood’s dreams, surely. But, astonishingly, it has now emerged that truth may indeed be as strange as fiction. According to Zero Dark Thirty, a forthcoming film about the hunt for Bin Laden — whose makers were given top-level access to those involved — he might never have been found if it hadn’t been for an attractive young female CIA agent every bit as troublesome as Homeland’s Carrie Mathison. CIA insiders have confirmed claims by the film’s director Kathryn Bigelow that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female CIA analyst, named Maya in the film and played by Jessica Chastain. And just as in Homeland, the real agent has been snubbed by superiors and fallen out with colleagues since the Bin Laden raid in May last year. But who is this CIA supersleuth? Although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified, Zero Dark Thirty’s emphasis on Maya’s importance tallies with the account of a U.S. Navy SEAL involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book. Bin Laden hunt: A very different side of the agent was seen days after Bin Laden's body was brought back. She even started crying . Matt Bissonnette writes in No Easy Day of flying out to Afghanistan before the raid with a CIA analyst he called ‘Jen’ who was ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ and liked to wear expensive high heels. She had devoted the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and had become the SEALs’ go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target, he said. And while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in Abbottabad, she told the SEAL she was 100 per cent certain. ‘I can’t give her enough credit, I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing,’ Bissonnette said later. The commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought Bin Laden’s body back to their Afghan hangar. Having previously told Bissonnette she didn’t want to see the body, ‘Jen’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist’s body bag. She ‘looked pale and stressed’ and started crying. ‘A couple of the SEALs put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body,’ wrote Bissonnette. ‘She didn’t say anything . . . with tears rolling down her cheeks, I could tell it was taking a while for Jen to process. She’d spent half a decade tracking this man. And now there he was at her feet.’ Jen’s role in the operation passed largely unremarked when Bissonnette’s book came out but now the new film — which is released in the UK in January — has confirmed his estimation of her importance. Although she remains active as a CIA analyst, it is believed Mark Boal, Bigelow’s screenwriter, was allowed to interview her at length. It has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the CIA after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned American security upside down. On target: The agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda's courier network which led to his compound (pictured is the attack scene in the movie) According to the Washington Post, she worked in the CIA’s station in Islamabad, Pakistan, as a ‘targeter’, a role which involves finding people to recruit as spies or to obliterate in drone attacks. But CIA insiders say she worked almost solely on finding Bin Laden for a decade. She was still in Pakistan when the hunt heated up after Barack Obama became President in 2008 and ordered a renewed effort to find him. According to colleagues, the female agent was one of the first to advance the theory — apparently against the views of other CIA staff — that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda’s courier network. The agency was convinced Bin Laden, who never used the phone, managed to communicate with his disparate organisation without revealing his whereabouts by passing hand-delivered messages to trusted couriers. The agent spent years pursuing the courier angle, and it was a hunch that proved spectacularly correct when the U.S. uncovered a courier known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and tracked him back to a compound in the sleepy Pakistan town of Abbottabad. Fiesty: Jessica Chastain as agent Maya in Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Bin Laden . It was a stunning success for the dedicated agent, though she hardly endeared herself to her colleagues in the process. As one might expect of a woman . working in the largely male world of intelligence, colleagues stress she . is no shrinking violet but a prickly workaholic with a reputation for . clashing with anyone — even senior intelligence chiefs — who disagreed . with her. ‘She’s not Miss Congeniality, but that’s not going to find Osama Bin Laden,’ a former colleague told the Washington Post. Another . added: ‘Do you know how many CIA officers are jerks? If that was a . disqualifier, the whole National Clandestine Service would be gone.’ In . the film, Maya is portrayed as a loner who has a . ‘her-against-the-world’ attitude and pummels superiors into submission . by sheer force of will. CIA colleagues say the film’s depiction of her . is spot-on. If this is the case, then she shows . little of the feminine tenderness that serves Carrie Mathison so well in . Homeland and which Hollywood usually uses to soften female protagonists . like Maya. Instead, the film shows her happily colluding in the torture by waterboarding of an Al Qaeda suspect. And . Navy SEAL Bissonnette reported how she had told him she wasn’t in . favour of storming the Bin Laden compound but preferred to ‘just push . the easy button and bomb it’. Given that the bombing option would almost . certainly have killed the women and children the CIA knew were inside, . her comment suggests a cold indifference to  ‘civilian’ casualties. But then the real female agent is hardly your archetypal film heroine. She has reportedly been passed over for promotion since the Bin Laden raid, perhaps adding to her sense of grievance. Although she was among a handful of CIA staff rewarded over the operation with the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the agency’s highest honour, dozens of other colleagues were given lesser gongs. Fellow staff say this prompted her . anger to boil over: she hit ‘reply all’ to an email announcing the . awards and added her own message which — according to one — effectively . said: ‘You guys tried to obstruct me. You fought me. Only I deserve the . award.’ Although colleagues . say the intense attention she received from the film-makers has made . many of them jealous, they are shocked she was passed over for promotion . and merely given a cash bonus for her Bin Laden triumph. Glamorised fiction: The reality of America's battle against terrorism couldn't have been more different to the politically-correct hit TV show Homeland, in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided colleagues missed . She has also been moved within the CIA, reassigned to a new counter-terrorism role. Bigelow, who won an Oscar as director of the Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker, has said it was like being dealt a Royal Flush at poker when she discovered a woman at the heart of the story. ‘The juicy thing about Maya was the surprise of it,’ she said. One thing is certain: The emotional cost of her achievement took its toll on her. Bissonnette recalls seeing her again as he and his comrades got on to a plane back to their main base at Bagram in Afghanistan. She was sitting on the floor of the plane sobbing, ‘hugging her legs to her chest in the fetal position’. Her eyes were ‘puffy and she seemed to be staring into the distance’. When he tried to reassure her that the mission had been a ‘100 per cent’ success, she simply nodded and started crying again. He put it down to a mixture of exhaustion and relief for a woman who had, with almost messianic zeal, dedicated her life to hunting down the architect of 9/11.

A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it triumphantly by the forelock as he poses for a picture. If this were not so stomach-churningly gruesome it would surely become one of the most enduring images of a conflict where the rules of war no longer apply and horror reigns... if it is indeed real. Scroll down for video . Unprintable: A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it by the forelock triumphantly as he poses for a picture . Blood can be seen dripping from the head through the grill onto the smouldering cinders of the barbecue. While bloated and blood-stained, the face is relatively unmarked, its features, including a well-trimmed moustache, clearly recognisable. The image - which is too graphic to publish in its original form - was posted on a pro-government website hosted in Lebanon and billed as proof of a war crime. The boy in the picture is described as a member of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the head that of an Assad-loyal helicopter pilot downed with his crew by a rebel surface-to-air missile. There is no way of categorically verifying this image - with modern photographic technology, it could have been doctored as easily as it was apparently taken. But if it is a fake, it sheds fresh light on a war where the line between truth and propaganda is blurred beyond recognition and the extraordinary lengths to which these enemies will go to undermine the other. Joint force: Members of Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra hold a detainee as they transport him in Raqqa province, eastern Syria in a picture taken on March 14 . Imminent death: Free Syrian Army militiamen arrest a 'traitor'. Captured enemies of both sides more often than not suffer brutal executions in a war where rules no longer apply . Dr Craig Larkin, a middle east specialist at Kings College London, said - real or not - the picture reveals the sinister and growing role of PR in a war where simple brute force is no longer a ticket to victory. Where once battlefields were confined to rubble-strewn city streets, war-churned fields and dusty desert plains, they have spread online as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition. 'With the conflict now more or less at stalemate, it is fast becoming a tit-for-tat war of propaganda over who is committing the most barbaric atrocities - both for the benefit of local and international communities. 'The rebels have turned wholeheartedly to Facebook to promote their mission, regularly posting pictures and videos of their fighters having been tortured or killed by Syrian forces. Desolate: A man walks along a damaged street filled with debris in Deir al-Zor yesterday, which has seen heavy fighting in recent months . Warely bigger than his gun: A Syrian boy holds an AK-47 assault rifle in Aleppo, left, and a young female fighter, right, takes a break from battle. It is a war that has incorporated everybody, irrespective of age or gender . So young: A boy sells cigarettes on a street in Syria's northern city of Aleppo. In the poorer neighbourhoods of Aleppo, immersed in conflict for the past nine months, it was not unusual even before the war for teenagers to go out to work, but now what little childhood remained for Aleppo youngsters has gone . 'At the same time the government wants to justify to the world their line that they are fighting an Islamic terrorist uprising. 'It is an attempt to influence international policy by putting questions in countries like Britain's mind over whether they should be supporting such atrocities.' The website on which it was originally posted, goes on to list the names of the helicopter crewmen, claiming they were shot down as they travelled from Latakia Airport, on the country's Mediterranean coast, to deliver humanitarian aid supplies to villages inland. These 'martyrs' allegedly all survived the subsequent crash, in Idlib province, but were rounded up by the FSA's motley desert soldiers and all beheaded with butchers' knives and paraded through the streets on sticks. A Syrian human rights group says a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents. The Syria-based Violations Documentation Centre said in a report today that the regime's 4th Division runs detention centres in its bases in and around Damascus. The division is commanded by Maher Assad, the president's younger brother. It is considered a pillar of loyalist forces and is charged with defending the capital. The centre has tracked the dead, wounded and missing since the start of the uprising in March 2011. The claims could not be independently verified. Other rights groups say tens of thousands of opposition members of their families have been detained during the two-year conflict. According to the Independent, they are named on the site as as General Souhel Akram, parachute Major Youssef Ma’alla, Air Force . Captain Hussam Asaad, Air Force Captain Ayham Al-Hussain, 1st Lieutenant . Mohamed Ali Al-Dikar, 1st Lieutenant Maias Ramadan, and Sergeants Sarot . Ghanija and Mohamed Diben. It is not clear to which of those men the head in the picture is supposed to belong. Intriguingly, the website also . implies that the executioners were Sunni and their victim from the . Alawite sect of the Shia division of Islam to which President Bashar . Assad belongs, The Independent reports. Perhaps this in itself is not so . surprising, but it goes on to describe the perpetrators of the crime as . 'FSA gangs', while most such atrocities have so far been carried out by . Islamist militants - not these ragtag - and mostly sectarian - . militiamen. 'That they call them "gangs" is interesting', said Dr Larkin. 'It is an attempt to show there is no structure to the rebel uprising - that they are just a collection of disparate groups with no real purpose. 'The beheading element also plays into the government's grand discourse by highlighting beheading as a jihadist practice, further discrediting the uprising in the eyes of the West.' When approached by the Independent, . Syrian information minister Omran Zoubi said he could not confirm the veracity of the picture. Meanwhile, it emerged today that . Islamic militant group Hezbollah is backing mercenaries from neighbouring Lebanon to protect . Shiites on the Syrian side who claim their homes, villages and families . have come under attack from Sunni rebels. Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan . Nasrallah, leader of many of Lebanon's Shiites and a staunch ally of . Syrian President Bashar Assad, has said his group is supporting the . cadres of fighters who call themselves Popular Committees. It is confirmation that the powerful Lebanese militant group is playing a growing role in the civil war just across the border. Syria's regime is dominated by . minority Alawites — an offshoot of Shiite Islam — while the rebels . fighting to overthrow Assad are mostly from the Sunni majority. Assad's . major allies, Hezbollah and Iran, are both Shiite. Refugees: Lebanese Safiya Assaf, center, said she had to flee the Syrian border town of Qusair along with her husband, seven sons and four daughters, and their families after their home and three shops repeatedly got hit during fighting . Ruthless campaign: Syrian policemen performing during a live-fire military exercise. A Syrian human rights group today said a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents . Under attack: A member of the Free Syrian Army runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in Deir al-Zor yesterday . The sectarian tensions in the civil war have spilled over to neighboring Lebanon, which has a similar ethnic divide and a long, bitter history of civil war and domination by Syria. Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war. But more broadly, Hezbollah's deepening involvement shows how the Syrian civil war is exacerbating tensions between Shiites and Sunnis around the Middle East. Syrian rebels accuse Hezbollah of fighting alongside Assad's troops and attacking rebels from inside Lebanese territory. Across the border: Mercenaries loyal to Islamic militant group Hezbollah patrol neighbouring Lebanon to protect Shiites on the Syrian side who claim their homes, villages and families have come under attack from Sunni rebels . Defence force: Hezbollah's deepening involvement shows how the Syrian civil war is exacerbating tensions between Shiites and Sunnis around the Middle East . Camouflaged: Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war . In recent months, fighting has raged in and around several towns and villages inhabited by a community of some 15,000 Lebanese Shiites who have lived for decades on the Syrian side of a frontier that is not clearly demarcated in places and not fully controlled by border authorities. They are mostly Lebanese citizens, though some have dual citizenship or are Syrian. Before Syria's uprising erupted two years ago, tens of thousands of Lebanese lived in Syria. The Lebanese Shiite enclave on the Syrian side of the border is near the central city of Homs and across from Hermel, a predominantly Shiite region of northeastern Lebanon. One commander of the Popular Committees said Shiite villages have been repeatedly attacked and some residents have been kidnapped and killed by rebels. He said that prompted local Shiites to take up arms to defend themselves. 'We are in a state of defense. We don't take sides (between rebels and regime forces). We are here to defend our people in the villages,' said the commander, Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of fear for his own security. 'We don't attack any area. We only defend our villages.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It was billed as the day's marquee primary battle, but in the end it was an easy night for Mitch McConnell. The five-term senator from Kentucky -- who's the top Republican in the chamber -- defeated tea party-backed challenger Matt Bevin in Tuesday's primary. In Tuesday's other high-profile race, two Republican candidates in Georgia will face a July runoff for the U.S. Senate, CNN projects. According to numbers compiled by The Associated Press, McConnell led Bevin 60%-36% with 97% of precincts reporting. Bevin conceded, telling supporters that he had spoken with McConnell. That conversation was confirmed by aides to the incumbent. In his concession speech, Bevin didn't back McConnell, but he said he has no intention "of supporting the Democratic platform over the Republican platform." But Bevin appeared critical of McConnell and the groups that supported him, saying "the attacks that we have been on the receiving end of have made our opposition smaller people. It has cheapened their accomplishments and it has weakened the foundation of their platform." McConnell praised Bevin and made a pitch for reconciliation. "Matt brought a lot of passion and tenacity to this race and he made me a stronger candidate. A tough race is behind, it's time to unite. To my opponent's supporters, I hope you'll join me in the months ahead and know that your fight is my fight," McConnell said. How McConnell crushed the tea party . Kentucky was one of six states holding primaries on Tuesday and again, anti-establishment candidates faced long odds in high-profile Republican showdowns. In Georgia, CNN projects Michelle Nunn will win the Democratic Senate primary, taking another step toward following in the footsteps of her father, Sam Nunn. On the Republican side, businessman David Perdue led the pack with 30% of the vote -- well below the 50% a candidate must get in order to avoid a runoff, according to numbers complied by The Associated Press. Perdue will face off against Rep. Jack Kingston, who came in second with just under 27% of the vote. The winner of the July runoff will go on to face Nunn in November to fill the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. In Oregon, CNN projects Sen. Jeff Merkley has won the Democratic primary, and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is the projected winner of the GOP Senate primary. The two will face off in the general election in November. And in Idaho, CNN projects Rep. Mike Simpson has won the GOP primary in the state's 2nd Congressional District, turning back a challenge from tea party candidate Bryan Smith. 5 key primaries to watch Tuesday . While his primary battle ended up easier than originally expected, McConnell now faces a much tougher test against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. CNN projected that Grimes would win her primary. A rising Democratic star, she faced no real opposition in her primary and already has had big names -- such as former President Bill Clinton -- team up with her on the campaign trail. Speaking to supporters who held up signs that read "Obama needs Alison Grimes" and "Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell," the Senate majority leader tied his Democratic challenger to President Barack Obama and to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "My opponent is in this race because Barack Obama and Harry Reid want her to be in this race," said McConnell, adding that "a vote for my opponent is a vote for Obamacare and the President who sold it to us on a mountain of lies." Grimes, who spoke at her victory celebration just minutes after McConnell's speech ended, quickly fired back. "I'm here to tell you tonight, my fellow Kentuckians, I am not an empty dress, I am not a rubber stamp and I am not a cheerleader. I am a strong, Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker who, when I'm Kentucky's next senator, the decisions I make will be what's best for the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not partisan interests," Grimes declared. And she highlighted where she doesn't see eye-to-eye with Obama. "I don't agree with the President's war on coal. I think it's wrong for Kentucky," Grimes said. Grimes connected to big donors, big hitters . Bevin, a businessman from Louisville, announced his primary challenge last summer, and quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential DC-based anti-establishment groups. The race between the two men quickly turned ugly, and expensive, as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks. Anti-establishment Republicans felt that McConnell represented everything wrong in Washington and thought he could be knocked off. The Senate Conservatives fund dished out $1 million in support of Bevin and against McConnell. But the group recently became very quiet, with McConnell's formidable lead in the public opinion polls. Large campaign war chest . But McConnell had a large campaign war chest, as well as the backing from two Kentucky-based super PACs, and such powerful national groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association. And McConnell ended his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from Kentucky's other Republican senator, Rand Paul, the one-time upstart who beat McConnell's pick in the 2010 GOP Senate primary in Kentucky. But the two quickly mended fences, and Paul, who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians, backed McConnell last year before Bevin got into the race. Paul congratulated McConnell in a tweet. The narrator in one of McConnell's two closing statewide TV commercials says, "On Tuesday, join with Rand Paul and vote for Mitch McConnell." And the spot includes a clip of Paul saying last year that Kentucky "ought to be proud of having Senator McConnell." Earlier this year McConnell predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right, saying, "I think we are going to crush them everywhere." McConnell told the New York Times that when it came to tea party challenges, "I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country." His prediction might come true, as McConnell's defeat of Bevin was the latest in a string of victories for incumbent and more moderate Republicans over candidates backed by tea party activists and other grassroots and anti-establishment groups. Soon after the race in Kentucky was called for McConnell, two of the groups backing Bevin closed ranks behind the Senate minority leader. "Now it's time for Republicans to unite for victory in November," said a statement from the Senate Conservatives Fund. And the Madison Project released a statement saying, "We congratulate McConnell on winning the primary. We ask all Republicans to come together to defeat extremist Hollywood liberal Allison Lundergan Grimes this fall." Now it's on to November's midterm elections, where Democrats -- who hold a 55-45 majority in the chamber (including two independents who caucus with the party -- are defending 21 of the 36 seats in play, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. Key races to watch . The only states where the Democrats currently hope to play offense are Kentucky and Georgia. If the GOP flips six Democratic held seats, they'll will win control of the chamber, and McConnell will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader. McConnell made a pitch for that promotion in his victory speech, saying " we can take the reins of power away from Harry Reid and make this President accountable. Make me the majority leader and Kentucky will lead America." A big question right now is whether Bevin and his supporters will rally around McConnell, or if they sit it out come November. In 2010, after Paul topped McConnell-backed candidate Trey Grayson, the minority leader was quick to bring all sides together at a unity rally. The battle ahead . The faceoff in Kentucky should continue to be heated, and expensive. When all's said and done, the race could become the most expensive Senate campaign in history, breaking the $82 million record set in the 2012 Senate battle in Massachusetts. Grimes, 35, is using classic campaign strategy against the 72-year-old longtime incumbent: it's time for change. "We've had 30 years of failed leadership under Mitch McConnell; we cannot afford six more," Grimes declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in Louisville on Monday. To counter that, McConnell is using a standard strategy for a longtime incumbent. He is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn Kentuckians about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in Washington representing them instead of a potential Senate majority leader. "My opponent, I certainly agree, is a new face, but a new face for what? New face for the status quo. Same majority leader, same agenda, no change at all. A new face for no change at all," McConnell argues on the stump. But Grimes' full-throated assault on McConnell goes beyond a call for change. She is using McConnell's GOP leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in Washington. Like Republicans all over the country, McConnell is trying hard to make this election a referendum on President Barack Obama, who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now. "Do we want to go in a different direction, or do we want Harry Reid to continue to be the majority leader? Do we want a vote for Barack Obama in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries? That's what's really at stake in the fall election," McConnell told CNN Monday. And the pro-McConnell outside group Kentuckians for Strong Leadership said they would spend nearly $600,000 starting Wednesday to run a television commercial that ties Grimes to the President. The problem for McConnell is that he too has a high unfavorable ratings back home, and Democrats here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall. The most recent polling indicates the two candidates are all tied up in the November showdown.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-13-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It's for just one congressional seat for about eight months, but Tuesday's special election in Florida has taken on huge political significance. National Republicans are framing Tuesday's special election as a referendum on Obamacare. But their message -- plus a flood of outside spending by Democrats focused on the issue of Social Security -- is drowning out other issues in the race, Republican candidate David Jolly says. His Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, isn't shying away from the health care debate, touting the law's benefits and saying she's open to improvements. Both parties are looking at this race as a testing ground for their messages going into the midterm elections. Florida's 13th District is one of a small number of competitive ones, and Republicans and Democrats say the tight race here will come down to which campaign gets its supporters out. Both sides have spent more than $11 million on media and direct mail, according to data from the Sunlight Foundation. The bulk of that spending comes from outside groups hoping to shape two very different narratives. Eight things to watch between now and Election Day . Republican groups and Jolly's campaign have concentrated on tying Sink to Obamacare and its rocky rollout and to President Barack Obama and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who have low approval ratings among independent voters. Jolly thinks the health care law is a top issue for voters, but the message he was trying to deliver last week at a senior center focused heavily on local issues. "There is a lot more going on here that just Obamacare," he said. Jolly served as a longtime aide to GOP Rep. Bill Young, whose death last October after representing the area for more than 40 years prompted the special election.  At the senior event, Jolly pointed out his connection to Young and the federal resources the late congressman helped to deliver for the district, saying Young was "nearly a father to me." Borger: Congress takes the year off . But Democrats are trying to make Jolly's work as a Washington lobbyist after he left Young's staff the driving issue in the campaign, arguing he backed changes to Social Security that could cut benefits. The district has one of the highest concentrations of voters over age 65 in the country. Talk about changing retirement benefits or any concerns that Obamacare provisions could affect health care coverage resonate strongly with voters here. Pre-emptive strategy on Obamacare . Standing next to former Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham at an event with seniors at her campaign office, Sink called the current programs "an American promise" and said, "those programs were put in place for a good reason, and I'm going to fight to protect the integrity of the Social Security and Medicare programs for all of us." Sink, who served as Florida's chief financial officer and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010, recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue.  She acknowledges that the Obama administration's proposal to cut the popular Medicare Advantage is a major worry among older voters, who she says will make up half of the electorate in the race.  Other Democratic candidates tend to avoid the O-word, but Sink talks about the law's benefits and argues she won't go back to the old system. Crist: Democrats 'ought to strengthen up' and support Obamacare . Sink's strategy on Obamacare appears to be pre-emptive: she stresses how the health care law will help people but also notes it has some major flaws that need fixing. She said she is open to Republican-backed plans to change the law's current requirement that employers provide health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week. She also said Obamacare's current requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees offer health insurance is "an arbitrary number" and says she wants to work across party lines to adjust the law to avoid any "unintended consequences," such as keeping businesses from expanding. Obama: Democrats 'sleepy' during midterms . Jolly reiterates the Republican mantra that Obamacare must be repealed altogether. Because his own campaign hasn't raised nearly as much money as Sink's, the bulk of the ads and direct mail attacking Sink are from the National Republican Campaign Committee and other allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Action Network, which backs GOP candidates in House races. Although he concedes it's not likely to happen, Jolly says he remains committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely.  He ticks through his plan to cover younger workers with a small government program and says he wants to make sure those with pre-existing conditions can always obtain insurance. Some Republicans worry about repeal-Obamacare strategy . He said Obamacare shows "two very different views of government.  We can talk about specific health care solutions, but it really comes down to a view of government that says we need more government in individual lives.  We need individual mandates and we need more interference between government and families versus a view of government that says no, we don't. That's wrong. " Some Republicans worry that the bright line the party is drawing about repealing Obamacare isn't the right tactic. Bob Sikora, a resident at the Regency Oaks senior community who supports Jolly, told CNN he thinks the GOP should be talking about improving the law instead of scrapping it entirely. "I would certainly think personally if I were in charge of his campaign, I would not have said, 'I'm out to repeal it' -- he's been forced to say that by some of the party higher-ups that control the tea party, which is controlling what Republicans are saying right now," Sikora said. Sink told CNN the concerns about the health care law are lower on the priority list for people in the district.  She puts it as "fifth" on the list of things voters raise with her at forums, after homeowners' worries about the skyrocketing costs of flood insurance, veterans issues, and the fear that any plans to start offshore drilling could hurt the tourism industry in this beach community. But one Sink supporter, Julie Meyer, who runs a retail shop in St. Petersburg, told CNN she thinks voters and the candidates should be talking about Obamacare. "I would like the conversation. I think there are blatant lies about what is being said about Obamacare and that's very, very unfortunate, because people should be able to decide with the real information," Meyer said. Texas kicks off first primary of 2014 . Democrats had a head start . Democrats had the advantage going into the race because they did not have to spend time and money on a primary.  Jolly endured a contentious primary in January and didn't have any significant resources going into the general election.  With no primary opposition, the Sink campaign went to work against Jolly early and stuck with the line of attack that electing him would send someone to Washington who wanted to cut Social Security. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and outside groups have spent millions to drive that message home and link it to Jolly's lobbying history. House Majority PAC, an outside group that backs Democratic candidates, has spent close $750,000 on one ad that says Jolly "lobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize Social Security." Jolly insists that Sink has misrepresented his position on the issue and says he would vote against the House Republican budget authored by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan because of the changes it would make to Social Security and Medicare. "They spent a million dollars painting me as an extremist and a million dollars on Social Security and Medi-scare and Social Security claims that are false," the GOP candidate told CNN. Poll: Anti-incumbent feelings at all-time high . Jolly reiterates he opposes the proposals to privatize retirement accounts or alter how Medicare benefits are structured. "I think the current reform plans are too aggressive, and I don't think we should pursue them," Jolly said. Republicans privately acknowledge that Sink's ability to start her ads early, combined with the fact that her campaign and the outside groups supporting her are outspending them, has hurt. David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report, told CNN that "Democrats have been more consistent with their message in this race, building a narrative about Jolly as a lobbyist who operates behind closed doors, and that has clearly helped." District is evenly split . This district is split down the political middle -- 37% of those registered to vote are Republicans, about 35% are Democrats and 28% are unaffiliated or back a third-party candidate.  There is a libertarian candidate, Lucas Overby, competing in the race, and he has participated in the three major debates. But it's unclear what kind of impact he'll have in drawing votes away from Jolly or Sink. Florida allows absentee voting by mail, and well over half of those who were mailed ballots have returned them.  In past election cycles, Republicans have traditionally posted a stronger return rate of absentee ballots, but the Pinellas County supervisors office reports that the GOP holds about a 4-point edge over Democrats sending in their ballots. Voters here frequently mention their distaste for the gridlock in Washington, and supporters of both Sink and Jolly told CNN they aren't sure that their candidate will be able to change much. Tami Simms, a registered independent who backed Young in the past and works as a Realtor in St. Petersburg, told CNN she's voting for Sink.  But she's unsure a new, more junior representative will deliver the same results. "I know there are some concerns that no one is going to have (the) power that Congressman Young had from his tenure and from his longtime experience. There was more than just his tenure that allowed him to move funding for projects in this area." If Jolly wins on Tuesday, Republicans will certainly say retaining this competitive seat is a validation of their plan to make Obamacare the central issue this fall. A Democratic victory could have other candidates across the country adopting Sink's approach to discussing health care with a "fix-it" attitude. House Speaker John Boehner made it clear that even if the Democrats manage to pick up this seat, his party's midterm strategy won't change.  Asked if a loss in this special election could alter the GOP message of repealing Obamacare, Boehner replied simply, "No."</div></td></tr><tr>

The 33-year-old Brazilian has been a big name in fashion for the last few years, featuring in high end magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair and Love. But her latest job as the face of American haircare giant Redken's Chromatics campaign is a huge leap in the way that traditional organisations treat transgender people. Lea T has made history as first trans model to front a global cosmetics brand with her new campaign for Redken (pictured). She is one of a number of transgender models changing the face of fashion . She is one of a number of transgender models changing the face of fashion. Femail introduces the transgender models who are creating waves in the industry, fronting campaigns and appearing in catwalk shows across the globe . Lea T is Givency head designer Riccardo Tisci's muse . Lea T . Age: 33 . Nationality: Brazilian . In 1981, Lea T was born as a boy called Leandro in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. She comes from a close-knit family with three siblings and her father is the famous footballer Toninho Cerezo. Despite being aware that she was different from other children, Lea refused to give any thought to the idea of changing her sex in her late teens and early twenties. It was only when she became friends with the now-Givency head designer Riccardo Tisci while he was studying at St Central St Martins that Lea began to give any thought to becoming transgender. She later recalled in an interview with French Vogue: 'One night he encouraged me to wear pumps to a party. 'We went shopping for 'drag queen' shoes and we bleached my eyebrows. It was a revelation.' Lea then went on to become Riccardo's muse. In 2008, Lea started hormone replacement therapy and in 2012 underwent full gender reassignment surgery in Thailand. She has had several high-profile modelling jobs, including a 2011 cover of LOVE magazine where she was pictured kissing Kate Moss. Andreja Pejic was the face of an ad campaign for Marc Jacobs . Andreja Pejic . Age: 23 . Nationality: Bosnia Croat and Bosnia Serb . Andreja Pejic was born as a boy called Andrej in Bosnia and Herzegovina but had to flee to Serbia during the Bosnian War. She and her brother Igor, their mother and grandmother then sheltered in a refugee camp near Belgrade and the family later emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. While still a schoolboy, Andreja was discovered by a modelling scout as was working behind the counter in McDonald's. The agency initially wanted him to bulk up and take on work as an underwear model, but eventually agreed on a different direction. She was the face of an ad campaign in 2011 for Marc Jacobs and walked the catwalk for him, Vivienne Westwood and Jean Paul Gaultier. In early 2014, Andreja underwent gender reassignment surgery to fully become a woman. She told The Telegraph 2011: 'Fashion is quite inclusive and good at embracing different things and different forms of beauty. 'It’s a very liberal industry. You can be yourself. Just not overweight.' Jenna Talackova is a model who also competed in Miss Universe . Jenna Talackova . Age: 26 . Nationality: Canadian . Jenna Talackova is of Czech and Babine descent, but was born and raised in Vancouver. She started gender reassignment at the age of 14 while still at school and completed it aged 19. While Jenna has extensive modelling experience, she is best known for the legal battle that fought against Miss Universe in 2012. Jenna had initially applied to compete in the Canada section of the pageant and was selected as one of the applicants to take part in the first round. But after it was discovered that she was transgender and she was dropped from the competition on the grounds that only 'naturally born' women were allowed to enter and she was dropped from the competition. Jenna hired famous civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred to fight her corner and the decision we overturned. She also has a reality show on E! that charts her forays into the modelling world called Brave New Girls. Ines Loan-Rau (pictured with Lenny Kravitz) has posed for a number of campaign and also featured in Playboy . Ines-Loan Rau . Age: 24 . Nationality: French . Ines Loan-Rau is of French African descent but was born and raised in Paris. Ines started gender reassignment at the age of 16. She was soon after discovered by model scouts in the French capital, later moving to New York. Since then, she has modelled in several high-profile shoots, including the US version of Playboy. The Parisian was persuaded to come out as trans after reading Caroline Cossey's book I am woman - Caroline was the first transgender woman to pose for Playboy in the early 90s. She also posed in a sizzling photoshoot with male model Tyson Beckford for OOB magazine earlier this year that would make many women green with envy. She said of her decision to make the change: 'I just woke up one day realizing that it’s enough. 'I need to embrace who I am and be loved for what I am and what I have been through- without the fear of being rejected.' Isis King was the first transgender model for clothing company American Apparel and appeared on America's Next Top Model . Isis King . Age: 29 . Nationality: American . Isis King was born and raised in Annapolis, Maryland, where she came out as gay in high school. It wasn't until 2007 that she began hormone replacement therapy, eventually going through gender reassignment surgery in 2009. She has since said that she prefers the phrase 'born in the wrong body' to transgender. Isis worked as a catwalk model alongside studying for a degree at the Art Institute Of Philadelphia. She later became the first transgender contestant on America's Next Top Model and appeared on both the 11th and the 17th series of the programme. Isis  was the first transgender model for clothing company American Apparel and has appeared in several national publications including Seventeen and US Weekly. She told Huffington Post in 2013: 'Even though I am transgender, I've always identified as a heterosexual female, even before my surgery. 'That's just how I've always seen myself.' Carmen Carrera's fans started a petition for her to be included in the Victoria's Secret 2013 show . Carmen Carrera . Age: 29 . Nationality: American . Carmen Carrera was born and raised as a boy called Christopher Roman in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. After appearing on the 2010 series of RuPaul's Drag Race, she was quickly snapped up by Elite Model Management. Although Carmen has had a breast augmentation and nose job as part of her transition, she has remained quiet on whether or not she has completed the gender reassignment surgery, saying in an interview earlier this year that it was a 'private matter'. Last year, a petition was started for Carmen to be included in the Victoria's Secret 2013 fashion show, but it was unsuccessful despite collecting more than 45,000 signatures. She told CNN about her the petition had affected her, saying: ' 'It's kind of like validation. 'No matter how insecure I might be, no matter how un-pretty I might feel, there are people out there who look to me to be strong and to keep going and to keep proving people wrong.' Geena Rocero started modelling aged 17. She was invited to do a TED talk about her experiences earlier this year . Geena Rocero . Age: 30 . Nationality: Filipino . Geena Rocero was born in Manila, Phillipines and started competing in beauty pageants as a teenage - she used her earnings to buy hormones that helped her grow breasts and adopt more womanly attributes. After emigrating to San Francisco aged 17, Geena was able to put female on her immigration identity papers. Soon after the move, she had her gender reassignment surgery and moved to New York to fulfill her dream of becoming a model aged 21. It was then that her modelling career really began to take off - she was discovered by a scout in a restaurant and signed to Elite Models. She made headlines around the world earlier this year after taking part in a TED talk on transgender issues. She said at the time: 'When I became a model I thought I had finally achieved the dream that I had always wanted since I was little. 'My outside self finally matched my inner self.' Valentijn de Hingh has walked for shows including Comme Des Garçons . Valentijn de Hingh . Age: 23 . Nationality: Dutch . Valentijn de Hingh was discovered aged eight by a filmmaker, who filmed him intermittently until her turned 17 as part of a project around transgender young people. It was shown on television in Holland in 2007. In her late teens, she was discovered by a talent scout on a street in Amsterdam. Valentijn went on to walk in several high profile catwalk shows for designers including Comme Des Garçons. After she grew to plus six-foot, Valentijn changed career paths and enrolled in literature science at the University of Amsterdam. She has since been re-recognised by the fashion industry and is at the centre of speculation that she is reigniting her modelling career. Arisce Wanzer has been in several ad campaigns and was also hired as the face of Kenneth Cole . Arisce Wanzer . Age: 28 . Nationality: American . Arisce Wanzer was born in Woodbridge, Virginia to a supportive middle class family with a brother and two sisters. She had a happy teen existence as a male cheerleader, class prom king and shopping with friends at some of the best department stores. She graduated from the Art Institute of Miami in 2009 for Fashion Merchandising and Marketing, where she also remodelled herself as a woman. After leaving college, she worked at Ford Modelling agency, going on to become the office administrator. Since then she has become a model in her own right, doing a commercial for Chrysalis Lingerie, being hired as the face of Kenneth Cole and also featuring in Candy magazine among others. Arisce told the site Hairpin that her modelling career rocketed after she had a breast augmentation. She said: 'Things really took off when I got my boobs. 'I have always wanted boobs. One of my biggest role models is Victoria Beckham. 'She’s just a G. Out there, doing it all. She’s stunning. I modeled my boobs after her.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Nearly seven in 10 Americans believe the United States should shut its doors to foreigners traveling from countries that have seen cases of the Ebola virus, and six in 10 say there should be a total ban on incoming travel for everyone – including Americans – who want to enter the U.S. Republicans are overwhelmingly against issuing travel visas to people who have been to the Ebola hot zone, with 90 per cent favoring the no-room-at-the-inn approach. Older Americans also preferred a closed-door policy by large numbers. The GOP also leads the field in asking for travel restrictions on anyone entering the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. More than three-fourths of Republicans hold that view, compared with barely half of Democrats. Republicans also far outstrip Democrats on the question of 21-day forced quarantines for those entering the U.S. from affected countries. Two-thirds of GOPers think isolating potential patients is a must-do. Barely one in three Democrats agree. The stunning results come from a MailOnline/YouGov poll that surveyed 1,000 Americans, suggesting they're eager to see the Obama White House embrace the position of Australia – which shut its borders last Tuesday to all travelers from Ebola-stricken nations – and of Canada, which followed suit on Friday. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE FULL POLLING RESULTS . CLOSE THE BORDERS: Significant majorities of Americans believe no one Ebola-land should be allowed to enter the U.S. – not even Americans who have traveled to the worst-hit countries . VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE: Just 34 per cent of Americans say they have faith in President Barack Obama to manage the Ebola crisis the right way moving forward . SLOW AND STEADY WINS A GIANT RASPBERRY: The Obama administration should have been quicker on the uptake when Ebola first hit the U.S., according to 55 per cent of Americans, while just 29 per cent say the White House wasn't too slow to act . Americans overall are split on the question of mandatory Ebola quarantines, with 48 per cent saying they believe 'people who have been to Ebola-infected areas should be quarantined by the government for 21 days.' Another 29 per cent believe only those showing symptoms of the disease should be forced into isolation. Older Americans are the most likely to demand quarantines.Fully 57 per cent of Americans 65 or older fall into that camp, compared to just 41 per cent of those age 18 to 29. And Republicans are 75 per cent more likely than Democrats to insist that the government isolate travels who have been to west Africa. The Obama administration gets low marks for its handling of the crisis. Just 10 per cent of Americans approve of the job 'Ebola czar' Ron Klain is doing, with 40 per cent saying they have never heard of him. Only 2 per cent of Republicans say he's doing a good job, but Democrats don't support him either. Less than one in five of them approve of Klain's work on the issue. Fewer Republicans than Democrats – 24 to 44 per cent – have no idea who he is, an indication that Klain, a longtime Democratic political operative, has become a lightning rod on the right. Fully 54 per cent of Americans age 29 and under say they have no idea who he is. RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job . MEDICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA: While more than half of Americans approve of encouraging doctors and nurses to donate their talents in Ebola-stricken nations, a similar majority thinks that same volunteerism puts public health at risk back in the United States . Fifty-five percent – including 61 per cent of Republicans but just 13 per cent of Democrats – agree that the administration has been 'slow to react.' African-Americans match Democrats' 13 per cent showing, largely supporting the White House. Obama himself only wins plaudits from 34 per cent of the U.S. population, compared with 49 per cent who disapprove of how he's handling it. Not surprisingly, just 10 per cent of Republicans approve of how the president has responded to the Ebola crisis. Perhaps more shocking is that 35 per cent of Democrats wouldn't agree. Obama continues to be a racially polarizing figure as he tackles the public-health threat, the MailOnline/YouGov poll shows, with 51 per cent of blacks, 46 per cent of Hispanics, but just 29 per cent of whites backing him. A similar split dominated the question of whether Americans 'have faith' in the president to handle the problem moving forward. Fifty-eight percent of blacks say they do, compared to 29 per cent of whites. Just 16 percent of blacks have their doubts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which drew jeers for allowing an Ebola-infected nurse to fly on commercial aircraft, has the support of 39 per cent of Americans, four percentage points lower than the 43 per cent who disapprove of its performance. GOP HARD-LINERS: More than two-thirds of Republicans told YouGov's pollsters that they believe the federal government should forcibly quarantine people who enter the US after spending time in Ebola-affected nations . DEMOCRATIC SOFTIES: Fully 62 per cent of Democrats believe there's no need for a 21-day quarantine when people enter the country from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea . The Obama White House has assumed a leading role in the global fight against the deadly disease, which has infected more than 10,000 people in Africa. But barely one-third of Americans say the public-health mop-up is the responsibility of the United States. Nearly half say it's not. The administration's efforts have included deploying military men and women by the thousands to help build field hospitals in Liberia and build other critical infrastructure. The CDC has also encouraged scientists and medical personnel to volunteer their time and skills in the Ebola hot zone. But while more than half of Americans think it's a good idea to nudge doctors and nurses toward western Africa, they feel the opposite about uniformed servicemen and women. Younger Americans, those under age 29, are the most likely to have their doubts about putting a lab-coated cadre of temperature-takers in harm's way. Just 44 per cent of them approve and one-third are undecided – making them the largest demographic group to be scratching their heads over the question. Most of the U.S. medical volunteers who have served or are serving overseas combating Ebola are under age 30, according to a physician source at Doctors Without Borders, an international medical relief charity. A clear majority, 53 per cent, say the federal government should not be 'sending military personnel to Ebola-infected areas of Africa to help battle the disease.' That number includes 67 per cent of Republicans but just 40 per cent of Democrats, an unusual case where dovish liberals prefer to deploy troops and hawkish conservatives would rather not. Just three in 10 overall approve of the Pentagon's deployments. 34 PER CENT FOR OBAMA: The president barely has one-third of Americans behind him as he battles the Ebola scourge, and nearly one-half disapprove of how he's handling it . RESERVING JUDGMENT ON CHRIS CHRISTIE: The pugnacious New Jersey governor who insists his quarantine policy is the right path has left nearly 2 in 5 Americans unsure what to think – but he's winning over more than he's offending . CDC GAP AT FIVE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a five point approval-gap on Ebola, with 39 per cent saying the agency is doing well and 44 per cent disagreeing – and among those with strong feelings, the dissenters outnumber the applauders nearly two-to-one . The thorny question of what happens to Americans who have been exposed to the Ebola virus is still vexing the Obama administration. Already more than 100 military personnel, including a commanding major general, have entered 21-day quarantines on an military base in Italy – to the consternation of the Italian military stationed there. And nurse Kaci Hickox's refusal to remain isolated during the disease's potential incubation period became national news after she returned from Africa via the Newark, New Jersey airport. She had a 101-degree fever when she was tested hours after her arrival. Hickox spent three days in a hospital isolation tent before the CDC cleared her to go home to the far northern reaches of Maine. She has defied public health authorities since then by taking bike rides and strolls, shaking hands with reporters – including one from MailOnline – and doing her own shopping. The MailOnline/YouGov poll found that more than half of Americans believe that by giving a green light to medical volunteers, the federal government 'could increase the risk of Ebola being brought to the United States.' BRING THEM HOME: A majority of Americans think it was a mistake to send military servicemen and women to western Africa, where they have been building field hospitals and providing infrastructure help – but also potentially exposing them to the deadly Ebola virus . INSIDE THE NUMBERS: Democrats who approve of sending soldiers into Ebola's path far outnumber Republicans who back that approach . NOT OUR PROBLEM: Just 36 percent of poll respondents said they agree that it's America's job to lead the global Ebola response, while 48 percent said it's not . This week Hickox and the Obama administration both crossed swords with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a feisty Republican who refused to back down from his insistence that health care workers who show disease symptoms must be quarantined before they can enter the interior of the U.S. from the Newark airport. Obama objected, blaming Christie – although not by name – for stoking fear by adopting a more stringent disease control regime than the CDC's, and the White House may have the public-opinion upper hand. Only one-third of Americans say they approve of Christie's approach. --- . YouGov polled 1,000 Americans on October 29 and 30. The poll has a margin of error of ±4.3 percentage points. About 90 per cent of those polled said they are registered to vote. The sample was matched and weighted to be representative of the general U.S. adult population on the basis of gender, age, race, education, voter registration, ideology, and geography by region.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Royal rift: Princes Andrew and Charles look glum at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee service in 2012 . The clinking of cutlery and popping of corks could be heard from the other end of the corridor. Behind the partly closed gilt doors of the grand dining room at Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales was holding court with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. The celebration to mark his 66th birthday was in full swing, with the couple’s closest friends charging their crystal glasses to toast the Prince. At the other end of the Palace, Prince Andrew was in his private residence sharing a low-key supper with a friend or two of his own. Sources close to the Duke of York’s circle say he had not been invited to the party and did not want to spend the evening alone. The fact that his elder brother had not extended him an invitation was no surprise to the Duke, his close friends or his courtiers. For the truth is that relations between Charles and Andrew have been strained for some time. And as he battles through the most challenging period of his life, Prince Andrew cannot count on Charles’s support. Accused of having sex with a minor – an allegation he categorically denies – the Duke of York’s reputation is mired in controversy, and a potentially embarrassing and unprecedented court case looms over the Royal Family like a dark cloud. But while Andrew has been cushioned by courtiers and protected by certain relations and trusted friends, the one family member perhaps best versed to help guide him through these uncharted waters appears to have turned his back. Numerous sources close to the Duke have told The Mail on Sunday that he has been ‘cut off’ by Charles who has ‘left Andrew out in the cold’ during his darkest hours. The ‘shutters came down’ according to one source close to a senior member of the Royal Family when Prince Andrew was named in US court papers by Virginia Roberts, who claims she was made to have had sex with him when she was a 17-year-old ‘sex slave’. She had been working for the Prince’s friend and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein – who had already been jailed for sex offences. Charles, no stranger to controversy when it comes to his private life, would certainly be well-placed to counsel Andrew and offer some sage advice, but it is said that the Prince of Wales has so far refused to discuss the scandal with his brother. While they have historically had fall-outs, Andrew’s friends believe this to be the most serious yet. Relations between them are apparently so strained that they barely speak. A friend of a prominent family member says that Charles – a great memo and letter writer to his family, particularly when it comes to matters of importance – has not written to Andrew for months. ‘The froideur is worse than ever,’ the friend said. ‘Charles considers the whole sex scandal degrading, damaging and very embarrassing. ‘He thinks that his brother has made some very bad decisions but he has said nothing to Andrew, he simply hasn’t communicated with him at all. There’s been a very icy silence.’ Charles’s patience with Andrew apparently snapped when he was photographed in New York with Epstein in 2011 after the tycoon had served an 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution. The ‘shutters came down’ according to one source when Prince Andrew was named in US court papers by Virginia Roberts (pictured with the Duke) The damage to Andrew’s reputation began to show when he stepped down as the UK’s Trade Envoy that year, but more damning allegations came in January this year when Ms Roberts, now 31, went to court. While the Prince of Wales’s spokesman denies there has been a fall out, insisting rumours of a rift are ‘categorically untrue’, sources close to Prince Andrew say he feels that he has been deliberately frozen out by his brother. Charles is evidently easily rattled when it comes to his problematic sibling – according to another well-placed source who is an acquaintance of Charles, the Prince will not have Andrew’s name mentioned in his presence. ‘I was told never to mention Andrew’s name in the Prince of Wales’s company,’ the source revealed. The tension between the brothers is a sensitive subject for the Royal Family. ‘This is no brotherly spat,’ said a friend of one senior Windsor. ‘It is a seismic shift downhill in Charles’s relationship with his errant brother which seems terminal. ‘Andrew is having to live with the harsh reality that Charles has cut him off and left him out in the cold.’ Andrew has been relying heavily on the support of his immediate family. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was the first to rush to his defence, saying on American television that Andrew is a ‘humongously good man’. But while there have been unprecedented public denials from the Palace, and a calculated show of unity from the Queen, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie Wessex, who all recently attended an engagement with Andrew, there has, tellingly, been no show of public support from Charles, who has refused to be drawn into the scandal. ‘He does not want to become involved in any way. He is very angry that his brother has put the family in this very difficult and embarrassing situation,’ added the friend. But his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was the first to rush to his defence, saying on television that Andrew is a ‘humongously good man’ ‘Charles has very serious concerns about Andrew. He can see legal fees going through the roof, there’s a serious risk of Andrew becoming involved in a court case, and unanswered questions about his friendship with Epstein and this girl. ‘Then there’s the fact that Andrew is still living with his ex-wife and has just bought a very expensive ski chalet with her. Charles thinks Andrew is making a fool of himself where Sarah is concerned.’ With Andrew’s aides swinging into damage limitation mode in conjunction with the heavyweights at royal lawyers Harbottle and Lewis, a firefighting PR strategy is in motion. Last month Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations are false and without any foundation.’ And last month in The Mail on Sunday, Andrew’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark broke her 32-year silence about their friendship in order to defend him, saying: ‘I firmly believe I can help rebut, with authority, the allegations against him.’ The Queen too has shown her loyalty in her own unique and subtle way. She bestowed the honorary title of Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy on her son on his 55th birthday last month, sending a clear and unequivocal message to the country that she was standing by her son both in private and in public. But the source from Charles’s circle said: ‘Charles knows the Queen will always be a staunch defender of her second son almost to the point of lacking objectivity and reason… which has irritated him beyond measure over the years.’ When Andrew celebrated his 55th birthday quietly and deliberately out of the limelight with friends, Charles was not invited to the private dinner. A close confidant of Andrew said: ‘He celebrated with some friends at a restaurant in Central London, but Charles wasn’t there. He wasn’t invited.’ The brothers did spend Christmas together at Sandringham where, by all accounts, they appeared cordial. Charles and Andrew do have a history of fall-outs. Andrew was said to be ‘spitting feathers’ when, in 2011, the decision was made to strip his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie of their personal protection officers. Last month in the Mail on Sunday, Andrew’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark, left, broke her 32-year silence about their friendship in order to defend him . The cost-cutting measure – endorsed by Charles, who is known to want a more streamlined Royal Family – was tacitly agreed to by the Queen and led to a dispute between the brothers. Andrew argued that his daughters still needed protection but his pleas fell on deaf ears. ‘Andrew was fuming, spitting feathers,’ said a source. ‘He fought and fought but he lost to Charles. ‘Charles is forging a path as the elder statesman and the force of the family and it’s his way or no way at all. In many ways it’s a rather Tudor court. The shutters came down on Andrew and that was it.’ There was further acrimony when neither Andrew, Prince Edward nor the Princess Royal were invited to join the Queen during the closing celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. With the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital suffering from a bladder infection, the Queen was left to carry out a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance accompanied only by Charles’s family of Camilla, William and Kate, and Harry. It was, according to one family friend, Charles’s decision that only the most senior members of the family should accompany the Queen to wave to the masses who had gathered in The Mall. The episode is said to have driven a greater wedge between Charles and Andrew, who resented his brother for the public snub. Moreover, it appeared to suggest that Andrew’s place within the scheme of things was becoming more tenuous. A source close to the family said: ‘Edward took it on the chin, there was no whining sniping or pleading, but Andrew was livid. He never forgave Charles. ‘Interestingly Andrew has become much closer to Edward and relies on him more these days. ‘It’s no accident that Andrew was allowed to put a picture of the Wessexes and the Queen on his Facebook page the other week. ‘It was published with the Queen’s permission and blessing and gave a much needed emphasis of the warm and close brotherly relationship between Edward and Andrew.’ A spokesman for Andrew declined to comment on private family matters, but a senior Royal aide dismissed the idea of a rift as untrue. However, neither would comment on the specific detail of how Charles and Andrew have behaved towards each other in recent months, saying it is a private family matter. A Clarence House spokesman said: 'Family relationships are a private matter but this story, as relayed, is categorically untrue.' Clearly, however, there is a coolness that is causing tension in the family – and it is being openly discussed. While the Queen, understandably, is reluctant to get involved it looks as though she may be required to act as peacekeeper once again.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-17-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The families of four men shot down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996 have condemned US President Barack Obama's decision to resume diplomatic relations with the Caribbean country. Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father Armando Alejandre Jr was shot down by a Cuban MiG 29 fighter in 1996 as he was part of a flight of three aircraft involved in a humanitarian mission skirting the island's airspace. Mr Alejandre Jnr, a Vietnam war veteran, was part of a group of Cuban exiles called Brothers to the Rescue. The group of three aircraft were flying in the Florida Straits to propaganda leaflets. The men also dropped aid to refugees fleeing the communist island on flimsy rafts. Marlene Alejandre Triana's father Armando Alejandre Jr was shot down by Cuban MiGs in February 1996 . Gerardo Hernandez, pictured, was convicted in connection with the shooting down of the two aircraft . Mirta Costa, left, and Maggie Alejandre-Kuly, right, who lost a brother and a son in the attack both condemned the decision to release Gerardo Hernandez who was convicted in connection with shooting the aircraft . Armando Alejandre Jnr, right and Carlos Costa, right, were shot down on February 26, 1996 . Mario de la Pena, pictured,  was one of the pilots shot down by Cuban MiGs while on a humanitarian flight . Cuban authorities claimed that the aircraft on February 26, 1996 violated their airspace and two of them were shot down as a result, killing the four pilots, Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre Jnr Mario de la Pena and Pablo Morales. As part of a deal with Havana authorities, President Obama announced the release of the three remaining members of a group of spies called the Cuba Five. Among them was Gerardo Hernandez, who had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy in connection with the 1996 shoot down. Ms Alejandre Triana said: 'My three daughters will never meet my father. For the only person that we had responsible for what happened to be let go, it's a slap in the face to my dad.' Mr Alejandre fled Cuba with his family as a child after Fidel Castro took power and volunteered to join the US Marines after turning 18, fighting in Vietnam. Maggie Alejandre-Khuly, Mr Alejandre's sister added: 'We simply cannot understand how this could have happened, especially in the case of Gerardo Hernandez. This was the only modicum of justice we had.' The Cuban Air Force sent a MiG 29, file picture, to intercept and shoot down the aircraft in February 1996 . US President Barack Obama, pictured, announced the major unexpected  thawing in relations with Cuba . Members of the Cuban Five met with Cuban President Raul Castro, centre, after the three remaining members of the group were released from prison in the US yesterday after serving up to 15 years in jail for spying . While exiles believe the Cuban Five are spies, the five men are described as heroes in Havana with massive billboards calling for their release. Cuban children are taught the five men's names. Cuba insisted the men were intelligence agents monitoring exile organisations in Florida. Rene Gonzalez, who was a dual US-Cuban national was the first of the five men freed in October 2011 after he completed 13 years in prison. He was deported and allowed to renounce his US citizenship. Fernando Gonzalez, who is not a relation to Rene Gonzalez, was released in February 2014 after serving more than 15 years in prison. However, many Cuban exiles were angered by President Obama's decision to deal with the Caribbean island . Thousands of Cubans took to the streets to welcome the historic announcement in Washington . President Obama's decision will see economic sanctions on Cuba lifted, allowing a trade agreement . The final three men, Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Ramon Labanino were flown back to Cuba yesterday to a hero's welcome. The men appeared yesterday on Cuban state television with Raul Castro. In return, Cuba released American Alan Gross, who had been imprisoned for five years, and a Cuban who had spied for America. The announcement was welcomed in Cuba with the planned ending of the 53-year-old economic embargo. Milagros Diaz, 34, said: 'This opens a better future for us. We have really needed something like this because the situation has been bad and the people very discouraged. President Castro, wearing a military uniform addressed the nation claiming the two countries would work together 'without renouncing a single one of our principles.' Carlos Gonzalez, 32, who took to the streets in celebration said: 'For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences. It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.' Fidel and Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The U.S. initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalised U.S.-owned businesses. The Cuban Five were placed on billboards and are regarded as heroes on the communist Caribbean island . Fernando Gonzalez, pictured, was released in February after serving more than 15 years in a US prison . Rene Gonzalez, pictured, was freed in October 2011 and renounced his US citizenship after returning to Cuba . Antonio Guerrero, left,  and Ramon Labanino, right, were also returned to Cuba as part of the deal . As Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the US imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk. The Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba's Communist economic policies. In his address, Castro called on Washington to end its trade embargo which, he said, 'has caused enormous human and economic damage.' Ramon Roman, 62, said he hoped to see Cuba welcome more tourists. 'It would be a tremendous economic injection, both in terms of money and in new energy and would be a boost for average people who need it,' he said. Victoria Serrano, a lab worker, said she hoped to see an influx of new goods because life in Cuba has been 'really very difficult.' 'In particular,' she said, 'I hope we'll see an improvement in food - that there is trade in this with the United States, which is so close. Right now, even an onion has become a luxury.' Around the cathedral in Old Havana, people gathered in doorways and on sidewalks, gesturing excitedly as they discussed the news. Guillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as 'a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.' Alan Gross, who was returned to the US as part of the deal spoke with President Obama on his way home . Yoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, noted the development came with a price. Castro, she said, could now claim a triumph and that he had made a 'bargaining chip' of Alan Gross, the US aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the US freed three Cubans held as spies. 'In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,' she wrote in a blog post. 'It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.' Some dissidents expressed their displeasure at not being consulted by the US government about the historic move. Dissident Guillermo Farinas considered the move a 'betrayal' by President Obama who, he said, had promised that they would be consulted. Another activist, Antonio Rodiles, said the measure 'sends a bad message.' Others, meanwhile, were cautious, saying they'll wait and see what it all means. 'It's not enough since it doesn't lift the blockade,' said Pedro Duran, 28. 'We'll see if it's true, if it's not like everything here: one step forward and three steps back. For now, I don't think there will be any immediate improvement after we've been living like this for 50 years.' Opponents of President Barack Obama's sudden move to re-establish ties with Cuba have little chance of scuttling his effort in Congress. Members of the Cuban parliament, pictured, cried as they watched President Castro address the nation . His initiative faces some strong resistance among lawmakers and opened fissures in both parties. Criticism came mostly from Republicans, who say the new policy rewards Cuba's decades-long policies of repression, human rights abuses and aggression, but some prominent Democrats voiced opposition, too. Opponents spoke of holding up money to set up a full-service US embassy in Havana, blocking Obama's nominee as ambassador to Cuba or other such steps. But even if they were to pass sweeping legislation to stop what Obama wants to do, he could veto it and they are not likely to have the votes to override a veto. Even though Republicans will control both the Senate and House from January 6, they will face pressure from businesses and the farm industry - eyeing opportunities for commerce in Cuba - not to stand in the way of expanded ties. The Chamber of Commerce spent heavily in the midterm elections, investing $35 million to elect business-minded, predominantly Republican lawmakers. Its president, Thomas J. Donohue, said Wednesday that Obama's actions 'will go a long way in allowing opportunities for free enterprise to flourish.' Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, one of three lawmakers who flew to Cuba before dawn to escort Gross home, praised Obama's move. Leahy, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees foreign aid, said that over the years he's heard members of Congress tell presidents, 'Hang tough on Cuba and those Castros will be out of there any day now.' 'That was said to President Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, President Ford, President Carter - you see what I'm driving at,' Leahy said. 'The fact is they are there. The fact is, Cuba is still there. 'Let's start finding out ways to at least work through our differences, embrace areas where we are alike.' Another Democrat, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced opposition to the new Cuban policy.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was taken into custody Friday night, bringing to an end a massive manhunt in the tense Massachusetts capital worried by warnings the man was possibly armed with explosives. After announcing the arrest on Twitter, Boston police tweeted: "CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody." Authorities confirmed the man in custody is 19-year-old Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who escaped an overnight shootout with police that left his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead. The younger Tsarnaev was in serious condition, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said at a news conference. He was being treated at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Lawman said. Tsarnaev was cornered late Friday as he was hiding on a boat in a backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston. Police were alerted to his whereabouts by a man who went outside after authorities lifted an order for residents to stay inside during the manhunt. The resident saw blood on a boat in the backyard, Davis said. He then lifted up the tarp covering the boat and "saw a man covered with blood," he said. It was that call that resulted in an arrest less than a week after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, shocking the nation and leaving a city on edge. "There was an exchange of gunfire, and I don't know if he was struck," Davis said of the suspect. Authorities, using a bullhorn, had called on the suspect to surrender: "Come out with your hands up." Tsarnaev, according to authorities, refused to surrender. "We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat," David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police said. "We were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night most likely," Tsarnaev was taken into custody after authorities rushed the boat, Davis said. Closing a chapter . The standoff and subsequent arrest came just minutes after authorities indicated during a news conference that a manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty. Authorities had cast a wide net for the suspect, virtually shutting down Boston and its surroundings after a violent night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers, after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier and hijacking a car. "We've closed an important chapter in this tragedy," President Barack Obama said in a televised address. Even so, he vowed to seek answers to the motive in the attack and find out whether the suspects received any help to carry out their plot. The government is invoking the public safety exception to question Tsarnaev, meaning in cases of national security a person can be questioned without being read their Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official is not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters the "government has that opportunity right now" to invoke the public safety exemption but stopped short of declaring it would take that step, saying only the suspect was in the hospital. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant. 'Glad it's over' Word of the arrest spread quickly in suburban Watertown, where residents took to the streets to cheer the news that suspect had been arrested. "Thank you. Thank you. It was our pleasure," members of the Boston SWAT team said over a loudspeaker. Mary Sullivan was walking her black Labrador earlier Friday night when gunshots rang out in her neighborhood. "I'm glad it's over," she said. "The city and the people have gone through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young men." Bombing connection . The manhunt began late Thursday just hours after the FBI released photos of the two suspects in the marathon bombings. "Investigators are recovering a significant amount of homemade explosives" from the scene of the shootout, Procopio told CNN. It was not immediately clear what explosives were recovered, but the discovery followed a tense night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled a homemade grenade and five pipe bombs at pursuers after killing an officer and hijacking a car. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The manhunt brought Boston to a near standstill. The Boston Red Sox announced they were postponing Friday night's game against the Kansas City Royals "to support efforts of law enforcement officers." NHL's Boston Bruins also postponed its game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The city's subway, bus, Amtrak train and Greyhound and regional Bolt Bus services were shut down. Taxi service across the city also was suspended for a time during the manhunt. Every Boston area school was closed. Boston's public transit authority sent city buses to Watertown to evacuate residents while bomb experts combed the surroundings for possible explosives. Initially, authorities said the brothers started their rampage by robbing a convenience store. By late Friday, the Middlesex District Attorney's office backtracked on the allegation, saying an investigation determined that the robbery at a 7-Eleven was unrelated. Officer killed . The violent hours leading up to the capture began in Cambridge, across the Charles River from Boston, MIT officer Collier was shot and killed while he sat in his car on Thursday night, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. The two suspects, according to authorities, then hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in Cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers, a law enforcement source told CNN. At some point, apparently at a gas station, that source said, the driver escaped. Police, who were tracking the vehicle using its built-in GPS system, picked up the chase in Watertown. The pursuit went into a residential neighborhood, with the suspects throwing explosives at police. A shootout erupted and ultimately one bomber -- later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- got out of the car. Police shot him, and his brother ran over him as he drove away, according to the law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Richard H. Donohue Jr., 33, a three-year veteran of the transit system police force, was shot and wounded in the incident and taken to a hospital, a transit police spokesman said Friday. The officer's condition was not immediately known. Another 15 police officers were treated for minor injuries sustained during the explosions and shootout, Jennifer Kovalich, a spokeswoman for St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, said. Suspects background . Police believe the brothers are the same men pictured in images released Thursday by the FBI as suspects in the marathon bombing that killed three people and wounded dozens on Monday. At least 58 people remained hospitalized, including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count. The men are shown in the images walking together near the marathon finish line. The first suspect -- apparently Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to authorities -- appears in the images wearing a dark hat, sunglasses and a backpack. The second suspect, wearing a white cap, police said, is the one who remained at large throughout Friday until he was taken into custody Friday night. But the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers refused to believe they were involved in the marathon bombings and subsequent shootout. "It's impossible for them to do such things. I am really telling you that this is a setup," Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told state-run Russia Today from Dagestan. "My son would never keep it in secret. ...If there is anyone who would know it would be me. He wouldn't hide it. But there was never a word." The brothers came from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago. "My youngest was raised from 8 years in America. My oldest was really properly raised in our house. Nobody talked about terrorism," their mother said. The suspects' parents recently returned to Dagestan in the Caucasus region after living in the United States for about 10 years because they were "nostalgic," the father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told Russian state-run Zvezda TV. He accused someone of framing his sons. "I don't know who exactly did it. But someone did." A federal official told CNN that Dzhokar Tsarnaev came to the U.S. as a tourist with his family in the early 2000s and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not a naturalized citizen, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He came "a few years later" and was lawfully in the United States as a green-card holder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev had studied at Bunker Hill Community College and wanted to become an engineer, according to those who knew him. He then took a year off to train as a boxer. 'I don't understand them' The official said that a posting on a social media site in the elder brother's name included the comments: "I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them." Dzhokar Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin, a public high school, said Eric Mercado, who graduated a year behind the suspect. Mercado said Tsarnaev had worked at Harvard University as a lifeguard. "We hung out; we partied; we were good high school friends," Mercado told CNN. "We're all, like, in shock. We don't really understand. There were no telltale signs of any kind of malicious behavior from Dzhokar. It's all coming as a shock, really." Mercado said he lived a block away from the suspect and did not know his older brother. Dzhokar Tsarnaev is currently registered as a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, which ordered its campus evacuated on Friday. The school is located 65 miles south of Cambridge, just west of New Bedford. Larry Aaronson, Dzhokar Tsarnaev's neighbor and a former teacher at the high school Tsarnaev attended, called him a "wonderful kid." "He was so grateful to be here, he was compassionate, he was caring, he was jovial," Aaronson told CNN.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-19-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">These shocking photos show child immigrants crammed inside cages and tiny rooms at a U.S. Government border facility - further highlighting the humanitarian crisis along America's border with Mexico. The images were taken at a holding center in Texas which can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling alone with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities. Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, took the photos on his camera phone to highlight the terrible conditions children are being kept in. Caged: Congressman Henry Cuellar took these shocking images to highlight how overwhelmed the US authorities are with the recent tide of illegal immigrants . Young faces: The pictures, taken recently, show just how many of the illegal immigrants are children - many of whom have no supervising adult. Up to 400 a day are pouring over the border . In one snap, taken during a tour of the Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas, a large group of immigrants are locked in a wire mesh cage. In another, tiny children run around a packed room and foil sheets – the only blankets they have – cover the concrete floors. Up to 40 people a time - most appearing dirty and dejected - can be seen in filling rooms only large enough for ten. This comes as the MailOnline learns that overworked border patrol officers struggling to cope with the huge influx are separating diseased child immigrants with make-shift quarantine methods - yellow evidence tape. Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition, said border guards were simply running a strip of tape down the center of the detention facility to separate the children. ‘The diseased kids sit on one side and the healthy children on the other,’ he said. 'Hardly the best way to go about things'. Mr Ray went on to describe the relocation of immigrants as akin to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina. 'You can’t have an influx of people like that without having an impact,’ he said. Flood: Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition compared the situation to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina . Cheek-by-jowl: The immigrants are crammed in tiny rooms and forced to sleep on the floor with aluminium blankets as their only comfort . More than 400 children a day are flooding illegally in to the U.S. and the tide of border crossings by unaccompanied children mostly from Central America is not expected to end anytime soon. Today it emerged that despite the influx Vice President Joe Biden believes more, not fewer, immigrants should come to America. Speaking to a National Association of Manufacturers’ crowd this week he called for a 'constant, unrelenting stream' of new immigrants — 'not dribbling (but) significant flows,' to bolster the national economy, The Hill reported. ‘We need it badly from a purely — purely economic point of view,’ Mr Biden said, The Hill reported. Later, on Twitter, he wrote: ‘The final thing we need to do together is pass immigration reform … We need it badly. -VP at manufacturing summit.' His comments come as border patrol agents are appealing to the federal government to help with the thousands of illegal children pouring across the border.

Appeal: Border patrol agents are appealing to the federal government to help with the thousands of illegal children pouring across the border . Yesterday the MailOnline saw lines of children being corralled by staff at a makeshift border patrol warehouse in Nogales, Arizona being used as a central hub to process the flood of immigrants. There were serious concerns for the health of the 1,100 children being held at the Nogales facility after MailOnline learned paramedics were called out three times in a day. We witnessed a teenage girl being wheeled out of the make-shift detention warehouse on a stretcher and loaded in to a Nogales Fire Department ambulance. A spokesperson for the Nogales FD said: 'We were dispatched to a 911 call at the Border Patrol station to attend to a female minor who was feeling sick. 'Depending on the evaluation of the paramedic we will make a decision as to whether the patient will require a higher level of medical care. If so we will transport the patient to a local medical hospital.' The spokesperson confirmed that the call out was their third of the day to the Border Patrol facility and the eighth since June 1. Blame game: Obama has come under fire for a change in the immigration rules two years ago which sent a message out to Central and South Americans that if you are a young illegal immigrant you will not be deported . Unprecedented: More than 160,000 immigrants have been . apprehended in Texas' Valley sector in the first eight months of this . fiscal year, eclipsing the total for all of last year . Disease: A border guard said the resources are so slim that diseased children are separated simply by yellow police evidence tape . We . witnessed the youngsters being processed in a yard outside the normally . unused facility in an industrial area on the outskirts of the border . town. Staff set up tents and giant fans in the 100 degree heat and large green screens were used to keep the children hidden. A . border patrol officer manning the main gate at the U.S Border Patrol . location told MailOnline that 200 extra officers had been drafted in to . help. Local hotels were also packed out with the influx of government officials here to tackle the problem. The much needed response came after pictures of unaccompanied children lying on the floor of the large barren facility raised concerns of a humanitarian crisis. And now these latest photos out of Texas increase the urgency of the situation. A wave of unaccompanied child immigrants have been arriving at the giant holding center in Texas at an alarming rate. More than 160,000 immigrants have been apprehended in Texas' Valley sector in the first eight months of this fiscal year, eclipsing the total for all of last year. Emergency: A girl is taken out on a stretcher from the Nogales camp - the third taken to hospital on Thursday . Health problems: There have been many reports of health problems amid the crush of people at Nogales . This figure includes more than 33,000 unaccompanied children. It’s . believed as many as 90,000 unaccompanied children will cross the . Mexican border illegally this year in total — up from an average 6,500 . over years past. As many as 1,100 children are currently at the holding center in Nogales. The children are sleeping in plastic cots but about 2,000 mattresses have reportedly been ordered, and medical supplies and other basics are being shipped. Conditions are slowly improving, with shower facilities being added and donations of clothing being collected for the children. Vendors are being contracted to provide the children with nutritional meals, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide counseling and recreational activities. Yesterday MailOnline witnessed a large FedEx truck making a delivery to the rear of the warehouse. Nogales Mayor Arturo Garina insists the site is simply addressing the immediate need for shelter. ‘I'm very comfortable with what I saw,’ he told CNN. Sickness: Thousands of children have been transported to Nogales, Arizona, and have reportedly become sickened by the food they have been given at the shelter . PR disaster: Large green screens were used to keep the children hidden at the Nogales Border Patrol station in Arizona . He said there are makeshift cafes and medical centers and that telephone banks and computers have been set up to process people and contact relatives. Unaccompanied children and partial families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala make up the majority of those crossing the border. Of the 1,200 or so crossing the Rio Grande in eastern Texas every day, up to 400 are unaccompanied children, said Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents the district where most of the crossings occur. 'This is a humanitarian crisis,' he said. It’s believed many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender. The illegal immigrants include a group of Honduran girls, some as young as 14, according to CNN. Many in Congress have blamed President Barack Obama for policies they claim opened the floodgate of unaccompanied child immigrants. According to the Houston Chronicle, several advocacy organizations have lodged complaints with Department of Homeland Security officials on behalf of more than 100 unaccompanied youths alleging mistreatment by Customs and Border Patrol agents within the past year. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified Wednesday before a Congressional committee that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has 70 personnel dedicated full time to coordinating humanitarian relief efforts for the surge of unaccompanied children caught at the border. The government has resorted to using three military installations to house an overflow of child immigrants, including an Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas. Nogales Border Patrol station: Staff set up tents and giant fans in the 100 degree heat . Conspiracy: An association of former border guards has accused the government of deliberately 'orchestrating' the flood of minors for 'political reasons' The Obama . administration is attributing the huge influx to violence in poverty . stricken nations such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. But some members of Congress say Obama's policies and a lack of enforcement are to blame. ‘The . President has sent the message out he is not going to enforce the law,’ Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican whose commentary on immigration . reform drew sharp criticism, told CNN. ‘That message has echoed out.’ Critics, . such as King, point to Obama's decision in 2012 to stop most . deportations of young people brought to the United States as children. After . the children at Nogales have been processed, they will be transferred . to Department of Health and Human Services run facilities at Lackland . Air Base in Texas or Ventura County Naval Base in California. The administration announced that a third facility in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which will house up to 1,200 minors. U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision 'within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,' an official said. Relatives living in the U.S. are searched for and contacted and the immigrant is given a court date.But very few actually show up and the children often become one of the millions of undocumented immigrants. Last night an organization of former Border Patrol agents charged that the federal government, under the administration of President Obama, is deliberately arranging for a flood of immigrant children to arrive in America for political purposes. 'This is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a predictable, orchestrated and contrived assault on the compassionate side of Americans by her political leaders that knowingly puts minor illegal alien children at risk for purely political purposes,' said the statement released by the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">They are the most celebrated Home Guard platoon in history, a band of men who changed the course of television comedy, if not actually the course of the war. But here they are as we never saw them at the time – Dad’s Army, out on manoeuvres in the wilds of Walmington-on-Sea. In a rare photographic record, cast members of the legendary series are shown mixing with locals in the fictional seaside town as they record episodes that will later delight audiences around the globe. But the backdrop is not exactly the coastal front line against Hitler’s planned invasion during World War II. Don’t tell ‘em, Pike, but it’s the countryside around Thetford in Norfolk, where most of the filming took place. And as these images suggest (to borrow a phrase from Corporal Jones) the natives certainly seem to like it up ‘em. Scroll down for video . Left to right: John Le Mesurier, who played Sergeant Arthur Wilson, Arthur Lowe, who played captain Mainwaring and James Beck, who played Private Joe Walker are pictured between shoots with Eric Burroughes, the owner of the farm where filming was taking place . Ian Lavender, who was made famous by his portrayal of the gormless Private Pike, is pictured on Walnut Tree Farm, Bressingham . Arthur Lowe has a stretch while standing next to Tim Ball, who appeared in the episode Come In, Your Time Is Up, as a boy scout . James Beck poses with extras from the Thetford Am Dram Society. Keith Eldred, the leader of the society, was often called on to provide extras for scenes and recalls that his actors were usually paid £10 per day . They posed for pictures with the cast, went to parties with them, enjoyed dinner dates together after appearing as extras in dozens of episodes – and occasionally kept the stars supplied with liberal quantities of alcohol. Now, as filming is about to start elsewhere on a big-screen remake of the comedy classic, the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society – membership 1,400 and rising – has turned the clock back nearly half a century to the days when Captain Mainwaring and his fearless men first invaded the inland market town. David Croft, who co-wrote the series with Jimmy Perry and lived in neighbouring Suffolk, asked the chairman of the local amateur dramatic society in the late 1960s to assemble extras for the series. ‘I quickly became very popular,’ Keith Eldred, now president of the Thetford Players, told the Daily Mail yesterday. ‘When we started to be paid, I became even more popular. 'I drafted in extras from all sorts of places – the drama society, the golf club, friends, my wife… even my parents featured in one episode.’ In total, hundreds of people were involved, including an entire Scout troop and the local Women’s Institute. Taking it easy: John Le Mesurier has a cigarette break between shots at Walnut Tree Farm . Clive Dunn, who played Lance-Corporal Jack Jones, relaxes in a chair in Nether Row, Thetford. While the series was set in the fictional coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea, most of the filming took place in Norfolk . Arnold Ridley, who played Private Charles Godfrey, is pictured on set. Michael Gambon will take on his part in a new film adaptation . Arnold Ridley, wearing what appears to be a fireman's uniform, sits on a bench in Thetford. These images are all that survives to document the Thetford filming, as the BBC either ditched or lost the other records . Mr Eldred, now 79, entertained the cast one day at a party in his house, which appeared in some of the backdrops. (The retired chartered surveyor’s wife Margot recalled: ‘They drunk us out of whisky and gin and everything else, but we didn’t mind.’) Mr Eldred continued: ‘They all signed our visitors’ book. They were charming company but they didn’t pull punches. John Le Mesurier was playing my piano and complained it was a rotten piano and was out of tune. It seemed to get better after a couple of gin and tonics though.’ 'James Beck [who played spivvy Private Joe Walker in the first series] was constantly chatting up all the girls. Clive Dunn [Corporal Jones] had what Mr Eldred described as ‘a rather cracking wife who used to insist on sunbathing in bikinis’. He added: ‘They were all lovely people. Most of the days involved us sitting around for long periods while they set up a shot, so some days were long and boring. But it was great fun, and quite an exciting time for our little community in Thetford.’ Virtually all the best loved episodes feature Norfolk extras in non-speaking parts or background scenes. In ‘The Test’, the platoon is challenged to a cricket match by the ARP wardens, who have recruited a top class bowler to their ranks (played by England cricketer Fred Trueman). Mr Eldred played short leg to Capt Mainwaring. ‘Trueman bowled one ball, which was all he was required to do,’ said Mr Eldred. ‘He then spent the rest of the day regaling us with some very doubtful stories about his career in Yorkshire cricket.’ At ease, soldier: John Laurie, who played Private James Frazer, is pictured during filming for the Battle Of The Giants episode at Frog Hill on the MOD Training Area in Norfolk . Expert camouflage: Bill Pertwee, dressed as Chief Warden Hodges, plays around on set during filming in Wacton. The crew used Rosalyn Barrett's house (pictured) for filming, and while she was only paid £10, Mr Pertwee agreed to take her and her husband out for dinner . Keith Eldred, the head of a Am Dram society near to where filming took place, became a popular fixture on set. He recalled that James Beck (pictured) 'was constantly chatting up all the girls' Arthur Lowe, in full Captain Mainwaring uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips, signs his name for two young autograph hunters . In ‘Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel’, the platoon is chosen to help test the War Office’s latest secret weapon. Some of the filming took place in Rosalyn Barrett’s garden in Wacton, a small village south of Norwich. ‘There wasn’t much happening in Wacton in the 1970s so it was quite something,’ she said yesterday. ‘I think we got paid £10 for a day’s filming, which didn’t exactly change our lives. But Bill Pertwee [Warden Hodges] came round to take me and my husband out for a meal, which was lovely. They were such pleasant people to be with, not uppity at all.’ Mrs Barrett, 65, still has a Kodak Brownie snapshot of herself with cast members, including one that shows her arm in arm with the ‘delightful’ John Le Mesurier. And her house is firmly on the Dad’s Army map – ‘Every now and then we get a coachload of fans coming by on tour,’ she said. The series ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak. It is still being shown on mainstream TV and attracts new generations of followers every year. The photographs are the only known record of the Thetford days, however – the BBC is said either to have ditched or lost any it might have had in its archives, along with the list of filming locations. Between takes on the set of The Deadly Attachment, Bill Pertwee and Edward Sinclair - who played verger Maurice Yeatman - are seen reading a paper (left). John Laurie and Arnold Ridley are seen waiting for the camera to roll on the set of The Captain's Car .

Dad's Army ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak . Clive Dunn stands with a local girl in Bardwell, Suffolk. The images were collected by the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who went to locations where the series was filmed and asked for snapshots . They were obtained by Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who spent nine years researching precise locations for a companion guide to the series. He traced many of those who allowed TV crews to use their land, property or services, and collected snapshots they took at the time. The prints are now part of the society’s display of recreated sets, vehicles and memorabilia at Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk. One shows Arthur Lowe, in full Captain Mainwaring uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips, signing his name for two young autograph hunters. Another shows actor James Beck in 1970s civvies as he relaxes with two clearly delighted am-dram stars in the making. Thetford being 50 miles from the sea, Great Yarmouth, Wisbeach and Lowestoft were used for some locations (how else might a German U-Boat crew get to Walmington?); and Thetford station became Walmington-on-Sea station whenever required. The closest the cast got to the heavily guarded wartime English Channel was Brighton, where filming was relocated during a 1973 BBC strike. Clive Dunn sits with a local boy on the set of The Desperate Drive of Corporal Jones, filmed at High Lodge, Brandon, Norfolk .

John Laurie and Ian Lavender would see who could finish the word puzzle first . John Laurie takes on another crossword in while sitting in Nether Row, Thetford, during filming for Time On My Hands . ‘The appeal of Dad’s Army is that it’s simple fun,’ Mr Pritchard said. ‘It’ s not vulgar or nasty – it’s just clever, straightforward, timeless humour… with brilliant writing and a magical cast that just came together so naturally.’ Only Ian Lavender – immortalised as ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike – survives as one of the seven main platoon characters. But reinforcements are on hand. As revealed in the Mail last week, seven new actors are lined up for a big screen remake of Dad’s Army, with Toby Jones, from Hunger Games, playing Capt Mainwaring, and filming is expected to start soon in Bridlington, Yorkshire. The proposal has provoked anger from some fans. Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Pritchard, who has met the directors, is not among the dissenters. ‘They know what they’re dealing with,’ he said. ‘They fully understand that it’s a national treasure.’ Of the original cast, only Ian Lavender (second right) survives today, as filming begins on a movie re-make of the television series . The cast of the new Dad's Army film - including Blake Harrison as Private Pike (fifth right) and Michael Gambon as Private Godfrey (far right) - are pictured lined up on the first day of filming in Scarborough, Yorkshire .</div></td></tr></tbody>
