It's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure. And that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army. A CNN team that's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that Iraqi army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the Shia militia, notably Hadi al Ameri, leader of the Badr Organization. Iranian military advisers are on hand, and highly influential on the battlefield. As ISIS fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands, it might seem odd that the Iraqi army is unable to take them on alone. After all, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of U.S. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment, bases and training. So just why are the ISF incapable of reclaiming territory seized by ISIS? And how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet? The answers go back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003; Iraq's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade. One of the most controversial acts of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein, was to disband the Iraqi army. The decision, taken in May 2003, "immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the U.S. occupiers," as James P. Pfiffner put it in 2010. President George W. Bush told his biographer Robert Draper in 2006: "The policy had been to keep the [Iraqi] army intact; didn't happen." The reasons have been disputed ever since. In some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers; at the same time training of Iraqi police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency. In 2004, as in 2014, the security forces buckled as a Sunni insurgency spread through northern and western Iraq. Billions of dollars were spent creating a new Iraqi army from scratch. But it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions, so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away. Over a seven-year period, more than $4 billion was spent on renovating and building Iraqi bases. Logistical and maintenance support: $2.6 billion. Supply of equipment: $3.4 billion (in addition to what the Iraqis bought themselves.) Training and staffing the Iraqi police: a cool $9.4 billion. With U.S. assistance and the "Sons of Iraq" program to coax Sunni tribes into fighting al Qaeda in Iraq, violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010. But once U.S. forces left at the end of 2011, and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs, things began to unravel. By then, the Iraqi security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty. The only effective units were special forces such as the Golden Division. Sophisticated U.S. equipment, such as M-1 Abrams battle tanks, was not maintained. Corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially. As then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013, the high command of the Iraqi military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-Maliki prized above competence. He bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies. The Institute for the Study of War reported in 2013, "the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-Maliki to choose his preferred officers (nearly all Shia) to head the most significant command positions in Iraq." Al-Maliki also began integrating Shia militia into army units. At the same time, the phenomenon of "ghost soldiers" went unchecked -- men who were either dead or AWOL but whose wages were still being paid, often to corrupt commanders. So the army, in numbers, looked much stronger than it was. In fact, by the time ISIS rolled south, the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000. Nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as ISIS fighters stormed south from Syria in the early summer of 2014. ISIS used speed, discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the Iraqi army didn't have. It had also cultivated allies among members of Sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column, and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee. The desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to Shia shrines in Samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of Shia militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the Badr Organization and the Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-Assad regime in Syria. In June, the most respected religious authority among Iraqi Shi'ites, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed to Iraqis to mobilize against the enemy.  The call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of Shia, determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. The militia -- called al Hashed al Shabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) -- were trained, equipped and most importantly led by Iranian military advisers and quickly became battle hardened. What they lacked in military skills, they made up for in determination. The Iranians have invested heavily in the PMUs. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, seems to have spent more time in Iraq than Iran since last summer and has been photographed around Tikrit. According to several analysts, it is Suleimani that has been organizing and directing the Shia militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations. Christopher Harmer of the Institute for the Study of War says the role of both the Iranians and the Shia militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the ISF. And he says that "if the Tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the Iraqi government's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the Iranians and the PMU are going to demand payback." The role of Suleimani and al Quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in Washington's view -- means that US airpower has not been made available. "The U.S. may not like Iranian influence in Iraq," says Harmer, "but what it absolutely cannot do is provide direct support to an Iranian-led military operation." The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, alluded to the dilemma when in Baghdad on Monday. "What I'm trying to sort out, actually, is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they're receiving from Iran is a reaction to the existential threat [posed by ISIS], or whether it is something longer-term," he said. Soon after taking office, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement. At the time a statement on his website stressed "the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels." U.S.-led efforts to train a new Iraqi army designed to defeat ISIS are well underway. The aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of Kurdish peshmerga. These should be ready for operations by the end of this year; the first brigade has already completed basic training. But as Harmer notes, "the Iraqi Security Forces are yet to go head-to-head with ISIS and win without help from the PMUs. ISIS is demonstrably more capable than the ISF." Clearing ISIS from well-entrenched defenses around Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, seems well beyond the army's capability. In November, Gen. Dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city. That's problematic for several reasons. Kurdish officials told CNN last month that the longer the battle for Mosul is delayed, the tougher it will be. They claim that they cannot maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely. The Iraqi government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there. But above all, the need for Shia militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely Sunni cities is fraught with peril. Human Rights Watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against Sunni communities by the militia. Tikrit is an especially sensitive area: in June last year, ISIS massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority Shia, at Camp Speicher. Some families of the murdered recruits, and a few survivors, have claimed local Sunni tribes may have helped ISIS or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage. HRW Middle East Deputy Director Joe Stork says that "past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter." Tit-for-tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides. ISIS' use of children: Propaganda and military training . During the Tikrit operation, both Prime Minister al Abadi and Hadi al Ameri of the Badr Organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected. Only when the city is taken, will we know whether their appeals were heeded. Harmer says he believes a majority of Iraqis want to see their country survive; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war. But it remains a possibility. One of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the Shiite militia and Sunni tribal brigades into the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than have them operate as independent armies. They are meant to constitute a new National Guard, but the mechanics and timing remain problematic. The leaders of these militia have tasted power; their men have shed blood. They are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when ISIS are beaten. And they won't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">As many as 1,000 greyhounds a year are being exported from Australia to Asia and South America where they are injected with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines to increase their aggression ahead of fight-to-the-death races. Just weeks after the live-baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs, possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by Daily Mail Australia. The dogs, both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives, are shipped mostly to Macau, Hong Kong, Argentina and Chile where they are housed in appalling conditions. Scroll down for videos . Australian greyhounds in South America and Asia are fed a cocktail of drugs before being 'run to their death' according to animal welfare groups. This one-time Australian competitor died immediately after a race . Bloodsport. The horrid outcome of a match race in Argentina after two dogs pursue the lure to the end. Animal rights groups in South America say they often descend into a fight to the death . The Canidrome in Macau where many Australian dogs compete. Animals Australia says 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and ... every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years' Although there are legal, strictly policed races, at the end of unofficial events the blood-thirsty animals often maul each other to death. If an animal finishes outside the top three in five consecutive races they are euthanised or dumped by the side of the road, where they starve to death. Argentina-based animal rights group Proyecto Galgo says that Australia and American dogs are particularly sought after in South America because of their superior pedigree. Animal protection groups have called for immediate government intervention, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers after the live-baiting scandal was exposed will lead to an increase in the black market trade to these gambling-loving countries. Australian dogs, along with those from the US and Ireland, are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes, and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners. In something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock-fighting rings or dog fights, activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight, with frenzied punters packed either side, and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint. Animal protection groups in Argentina have joined the call for Australia's Federal Government to intervene, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live-baiting scandal, will lead to the 'black market' trade of Australian greyhounds gathering even more pace . Killing fields. These stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in Asia . Freedom of Information documents obtained by Animals Australia from the Department of Agriculture and seen by Daily Mail Australia show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from Australia in Argentina in the past two years. It's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels. There is no information about the fates of these animals. 'Greyhounds here, including those from Australia, suffer a terrible fate,' claims an activist from Proyecto Galgos, who gave her name only as Ines. 'Here the situation is this; they use the galgos (greyhounds) in an exhaustive way. In one day, they can race in many places sometimes (and) are drugged with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines. 'Sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities. 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs.' Some, she said, are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs. 'That is the best scenario, but if they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed.' 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs' say animal rights groups in Argentina, who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one-time racing dog . If they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads, or left to die of starvation, and in some cases they are killed' according to Proyecto Galgos from Argentina . With punting, legal and otherwise, a major past-time in parts of Argentina and Chile, exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like Proyecto Galgos, with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis. 'Here (in South America) they are used as merchandise, they are objects and when they aren't useful anymore they get rid of them,' Ines said. 'Sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything.' Races are prohibited in two Argentinian regions, including the capital Buenos Aires and in Santa Fe. Cordoba is debating whether to shut down the industry too. While it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels, through the control of authorities via a 'greyhound passport', there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like Greyhounds Australasia. The exports, however, continue unabated. Lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like Argentina and Korea (which is not on the official list) remains a mystery. Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker admitted that GA has no control of the greyhound export industry. ‘We have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop,' he said. ‘It’s because of the lack of regulations, something we have stressed to the (Agriculture) Minister and hoped we’d get a meeting with him to discuss it but that hasn't eventuated as yet but we are still trying. Greyhound data shows some of Australia's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like South America. Animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the Federal Government to ensure the future of all greyhounds . Lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate, however, pointing to several examples over the years of top Australian greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected Argentinian studs . ‘The passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they (greyhound owners) were doing the right thing . ‘Exporting Australian greyhounds without a GA issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well. ‘They enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month, it’s out of our hands – a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world, if they want.’ He's also called on the Federal Government to put strong legislation behind 'the rules' of greyhound exports. There are examples of successful transitions; including star performers Bogie Ace and The Chief, who had top careers on the track in Australia and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely. They, however, are rare examples. Up until now, authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of Australian greyhounds to Asia, particularly Macau, for competition at the Yat Yuen Canidrome, but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in South America, has activists concerned. 'I think what’s clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority, these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry,' Lisa Chalk from Animals Australia said. 'In Australia, thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they don’t run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty. 'The country of greatest concern currently is Macau where dogs are raced at a facility called the Canidrome. 'They are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races. 'Dogs sent to Macau from Australia are dead within three years. Greyhound racing in Macau is built around the supply of dogs from Australia which makes the situation all the more outrageous.' Advocates also warn that, many of the export countries (in Asia), are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption. 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the Macau government’s animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years,' Ms Chalk added. 'Greyhounds Australasia has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that hasn't stopped the export. 'It's time for the Australian Government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether.' Animal advocates have called on the Australian Government 'to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether' to provide more protection for the animals. This is an example of a neglected pup in Argentina . The live-baiting scandal has led to more than 70 Australian trainers being implicated. Five Queensland greyhound trainers have already been banned for life . Animals Australia claim that 'greyhounds from Australia were killed at the Canidrome at a rate of more than one every day'. 'Nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old. All they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races,' Ms Chalk said. 'With an ongoing supply of dogs from Australia, this unethical practice can continue, and is even threatening to expand.' Macau is the only place in China where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded. Her South American colleagues agree: 'The shortage of quality animals (in South America) means the exporting to places such as Argentina from Australia can be a profitable business.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Minister for Agriculture's office for comment.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Chelsea midfielder Oscar, Barcelona forward Neymar, and Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo. France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner. CLICK HERE TO READ THE MATCH REPORT IN FULL . Host commentator . And that's it. Brazil come from behind in style to seal a 3-1 win against France and gain a tiny bit of revenge for their World Cup final defeat 17 years ago. Raphael Varane gave the hosts the lead with a powerful header but strikes from Oscar, Neymar and Luis Gustavo secured a deserved victory for Dunga's men. The Real Madrid man gets up and limps back but it looks like he's OK. Brazil's subs still working hard to close down France every time they get the ball. They've seen this out well. Fernandinho replaces goalscorer Gustavo with just added time remaining. Four minutes extra to be played. And off goes Firmino after a bit of discussion. Almost a debut to remember for Fekir as he picks the ball up on the edge of the box, creates some space and gets a low shot away which flashes just wide. Souza replaces Oscar. Schneiderlin bursts down the left and goes down after being clipped by Danilo. The Southampton man wants a free-kick but the referee isn't having it. Goal kick. Douglas Costa comes on for Willian and Giroud replaces Matuidi. Payet replaces Valbuena with just under 10 minutes to play. Neymar skips away from Schneiderlin, drives towards goal but blasts his shot high and wide from a little over 20 yards. To be fair to him the ball appeared to bobble as he struck it. Kondogbia replaces Sissoko and Fekir comes on for Griezmann. And there's number three! Gustavo gets away from his marker and heads the corner beyond Mandanda and into the corner. Awful defending but Brazil probably deserve a two-goal cushion. The visitors move up the pitch at speed with Willian and Neymar both involved. The Barca man picks out Oscar and his curled shot forces Mandanda into a diving save to his left. Corner for Brazil. Some neat skill and a long-range shot from Griezmann forces Jefferson into a fingertip save - possibly his best of the game. Valbuena delivers another good corner but Brazil deal with it. Within a minute of Varane's miss - with a Jefferson save from Sissoko sandwiched in between - Benzema misses a sitter. A deep cross found the Real Madrid man unmarked at the back post but he leant back and volleyed well over the bar. It really hasn't been his night so far. Another dangerous free-kick from France goes all the way through to Varane but he doesn't connect with his shot properly and the ball rolls harmlessly wide. Told you they were starting to play! Willian is involved again and he drives down the middle before laying in Neymar on the left. The Barcelona man takes a couple of touches before lashing the ball high into the net from an acute angle. Brazil starting to play with some style now. They work the ball around France's half before Willian tries to play a killer ball to Neymar. France clear for a corner which Silva almost converts. Sakho loses his footing and Brazil pick up the ball in a dangerous area. It's played into the centre and Gustavo strikes a low shot from about 20 yards which Mandanda does well to save. This time Valbuena picks up possession on the left side of Brazil's box. He makes himself some space and tries to pick out Benzema but his cross is poor and Jefferson claims again. Sissoko bursts through midfield and is brought down by Elias 45 yards from goal. Valbuena curls the free-kick into the area but it goes all the way through to Jefferson. France get the second period underway. How many substitutions we will see in the second half? I'm going for 10. France are struggling to get hold of the ball as the first half draws to a close. Willian combines with Danilo but the right back's pass inside is poor and France clear the danger. Lovely goal. Oscar picks up the ball on the left, plays it inside to Firmino and drives into the box looking for the return. The Hoffenheim man prods it into his path and Oscar produces a low finish with his first touch. Game on. Willian runs on to a pass down Brazil's right, takes a touch and delivers a cross. Brazil are lacking a physical presence up-front and it's obvious here as Mandanda claims under no pressure whatsoever. Firmino picks up the ball in a central area and drives forward. He makes some progress but is eventually crowded out and loses possession on the edge of France's area. Firmino certainly isn't afraid to have a go from distance. This time he picks the ball up about 25 yards from goal and forces Mandanda into a decent save low to his right. Neymar takes the resulting corner but France clear up. ...but this time Brazil just about deal with it. Sakho got up to meet it but his header looped up and into the hands of Jefferson. Brazil now have a free-kick inside France's half after a foul on Neymar... Elias finds some space 25 yards from goal but his shot is high and wide. Should've got his head up and picked a pass, there. France take the lead! Another inswinging corner from Valbuena is met powerfully by Varane and his header flies into the bottom corner. Nobody on either post for Brazil. First real chance of the game for Brazil. Neymar receives a pass just inside the area, uses a defender as a shield and attempts to pass the ball into the bottom corner. Mandanda is equal to it though, palming the ball away. Another mini spell of possession for Brazil but it ends when Oscar inexplicably fires a long pass across the pitch to absolutely nobody. Poor challenge from Filipe Luis, who scythes down the little midfielder from behind. The Chelsea man escapes a booking, probably because it's a friendly. Neymar closes down France's defence and makes an interception but the ball gets away from him and the hosts survive a scare. The visitors are starting to get on the ball a bit more now. Neymar drops deep to pick up possession but he's eventually crowded out and loses the ball in a dangerous area. Moments later Firmino finds some space on the edge of France's box but his low strike is blocked. Valbuena whips in a corner which falls to Benzema just a few yards from goal. The Real Madrid was completely unmarked but he couldn't direct his header past Jefferson, who palmed his effort away and hurt himself in the process. France should have the lead. Lighting run from Willian down the right. The Chelsea man gets past one opponent but a brilliant sliding tackle from Schneiderlin takes the ball away from him. Willian appeared to catch Blaise Matuidi but it's the Brazilian who is left on the turf. No need for treatment and he's back in the game after being helped to his feet. Brazil haven't had possession since Neymar lost his footing - and the ball - inside the first minute. Bacary Sagna and Raphael Varane both involved early on but no chances yet. Brazil get us underway at the Stade de France. France, Brazil and everyone inside the stadium take part in a minute of silence in respect to those who lost their lives in the Germanwings plane crash this week. Perfectly observed. Both sets of players are out on the pitch and lined up for the national anthems. The stadium appears pretty packed considering it's a friendly - looks like Brazil still have plenty of pulling power despite that defeat to Germany last summer. Four minutes until kick-off. Martha Kelner: The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries.

Kieran Gill: The way the unofficial World Cup final works is not unlike a game of conkers, where winner takes all until your next match in an all-or-nothing scenario. Brazil have held the unofficial title since October 11, when they beat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing, China, and have a chance to chase Scotland at the top of the unofficial World Cup ranking table. They have some way to go, however, as Scotland sit top with 86 points, ahead of England on 73. CLICK HERE to read more. Sam Cunningham: Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, by bringing back one of their grittiest former captains. Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland. His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time. CLICK HERE to read more. Starting XI: Jefferson, Danilo, Thiago Silva, Miranda, Filipe Luís, Luiz Gustavo, Elias, Willian, Oscar, Firmino, Neymar . Starting XI: Mandanda, Sagna, Sakho, Varane, Evra, Matuidi, Schneiderlin, Sissoko, Griezmann, Valbuena, Benzema . ...and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the international friendly between France and Brazil at the Stade de France.

Caroline gives readers a glimpse into the life of students behind the exclusive college walls - drinking on the college lawns, revising on the 'backs of Kings', attending garden parties and dancing at May Balls. Caroline captures a piece of iconic Cambridge bloom as she and her friends sneak into the annual Murray Edwards College garden party . The student blogs about her life with friends (Eliza, Eddie, Charlotte, Fergus, Maria, Osca) on campus and documents twee weekends spent with them in the country . Caroline, seen attending a formal dinner with friends Amanda and Axel at The Traveller's Club, Pal Mall, admits there are elements of our aristocratic traditions, which wouldn't wash in all-American New York City . Caroline, pictured punting with friend Robin Mackworth-Young, loves the British accent and says even when she can't understand what's going on around her, there's nowhere else she'd rather be . And she marvels at events like Trinity College's 'Court Run' in the Autumn, a race where students down copious amounts of port before attempting to run around the square before the grand clock strikes twelve. At times baffled by quirky Brits, Caroline admits there are elements of our aristocratic traditions that wouldn't wash in all-American New York City. She said: 'The Brits are so different from the Americans - I'm sure they think I'm crazy but unlike New Yorkers they are too polite to tell you. 'American college students like to drink shots at Frat parties but here they like to drink three types of wine at dinner. 'I got my room by chance but in the States they would find the fact that sometimes they assign rooms on test scores baffling - the idea that you get a better room based on grade just wouldn't happen in New York. 'Only certain people of a certain status can walk on the lawns - I think if I didn't write my blog or take photographs, my American friends just wouldn't believe that these things happen. 'It's archaic and almost medieval sometimes. I do think it's snobby, and slightly ridiculous but in an incredibly endearing British way and I find the old traditions just mesmerising.' Caroline jokes that she came to study in England to avoid the 'math' requirement set on college applications in the States. But when she isn't attending lectures in beautiful 'castle-like buildings', Caroline makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim, and she is currently working hard to blow off steam after exams and essays for the notorious 'May Week' - a week of parties and balls after the exam period at the end of the academic year. When she isn't attending lectures in beautiful 'castle-like buildings', Caroline, seen in her dorm, makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim . Caroline spends her weekends exploring the colleges and is amused by the 'no walking on the lawns'  rules . Caroline says life at Cambridge is 'just a totally different type of glamour' adding: 'it is another world' 'May Week is such an amazing week, everyone was already talking about it when I arrived in October, so I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype,' she said. 'But then May Week came and it was fabulous. I had to sell a kidney to pay for all the balls,' she joked, 'but it was totally worth it.' She continued: 'Tickets vary from £90 going all the way up to £250 for certain balls, which are white tie and only happen every three years. 'I don't think Americans even really know what white tie is. I certainly didn't when I first came here. It's just a totally different type of glamour, it is another world. 'America does a lot of things well: hot dogs, obesity and fun - but we don't do glamour like the Brits. 'I went to Trinity Ball last year. It is held in the most stunning setting, the girls all look beautiful and the men look like they're from a BBC period drama.' Caroline, pictured relaxing on Jesus Green, in 2014, Cambridge, says she wants to clarify that she is not one of those 'tragically old-fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband'and loves her degree . Caroline, seen with her friends in her Cambridge dorm, jokes that she came to study in England to avoid the 'math' requirement set on college applications in the States . Caroline is currently in the process of writing her book, a collection of funny essays and pictures about her escapades, which will be released in 2016 . Lifting the lid on working hard and playing hard, Caroline told how her and college friends have broken into garden parties and even accidentally stole a punt overnight. She added: 'Summer in Cambridge is magical. After exams, students punt to a nearby village called Grantchester where the picnics range from bucolic and stress-reducing to rowdy and Prosecco-fuelled. 'Last term, when we accidentally stole a punt, we ended up getting horribly drunk and abandoning ship. 'The next morning we got up early and hungover to return it before anybody noticed it was missing.' Caroline is currently in the process of writing her book, a collection of funny essays and pictures about her escapades, which will be released in 2016. Other anecdotes include the evening she and her boyfriend got trapped in the Palace of Versailles overnight and when she was featured in Hounds magazine because of her 'rather inappropriate hunting attire'. But her absolute favourite thing about Cambridge? The British accent. 'I definitely grew up with the Hollywood tropes of the American girl who meets the dashing Hugh Grant boy,' she gushed. 'I want to clarify that I am not one of those tragically old-fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband. I love my degree, period. But I'm not complaining about all the dashing British accents. 'I love that everyone sounds so proper and lovely, even when I can't understand what's going on around me - there's nowhere else I'd rather be.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Horrific: MIT police officer Sean Collier, 27, was found gurgling and covered in blood April 18, 2013 after prosecutors say he was shot in the head and neck by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or his brother in a failed attempt to steal his gun . A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who found a colleague in his squad car covered in blood three nights after the Boston Marathon bombing frantically repeated two words into his radio 'officer down, officer down.' A recording of that radio call was played to jurors hearing the trial of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, on Wednesday, as prosecutors turned to the charge that the defendant and his older brother murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013, in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun. Meanwhile, the MIT police chief revealed his last words to the 27-year-old officer in a wrenching fifth day of testimony in the long awaited Boston bomber trial. Chief John DiFava on Wednesday recalled chatting with Collier about an hour before his death. 'I told him to be safe, and I left,' DiFava said, adding it was the last time he saw Collier alive. The officer who found Collier, Sergeant Clarence Henniger, said he was responding to a 911 call about possible shots fired on MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, just outside Boston. Collier had visible bullet wounds to his temple, neck and hand and was so covered in blood that Henniger struggled to pull him from his vehicle. 'I could hear gargling coming from his mouth,' Henniger testified at U.S. District Court in Boston, where the jury hearing Tsarnaev's trial will also decide whether to sentence him to death if he is convicted of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the April 15, 2013, race. Jurors also saw surveillance footage of two figures approaching Collier's police cruiser on the MIT campus, spending about a minute at the car, and leaving. The only visible suggestions of commotion in the video are the car's brake lights, flashing on and off. Collier's gun belt and holster were covered in blood, evidence of Tsarnaev's clumsy but unsuccessful effort to steal his handgun, prosecutors have said. Tsarnaev's attorneys opened the trial by admitting he committed the crimes of which he is accused, but are seeking to spare him the death penalty by demonstrating he was following the lead of his older brother. Scroll down for video... Evidence: This forensics photograph released by the U.S. Attorney's office and presented during the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev shows a bloodied service pistol sitting on seat of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier's cruiser . 'Be safe': MIT Police Chief John DiFava testified he told Collier to 'be safe' about an hour before he was shot dead April 18, 2013 . Culpable? Tsarnaev's attorney says Dzhohkar's brother Tamerlan was the mastermind of the bombing and the one who pulled the trigger to kill Collier. Prosecutors say both brothers were culpable in the officer's murder and that they killed the 27-year-old in order to steal his gun and arm Tsarnaev . In the act? Video taken from above the site of Collier's April 18 murder purports to show the Tsarnaev brothers (circled) rounding a corner toward Collier's cruiser, at left (grab via WCVB) Federal prosecutors contend Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya a decade before the attack, was driven by an extremist view of Islam and a desire to take revenge on the United States for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. Prosecutor William Weinreb said in his opening statement last week that it was unclear if Tsarnaev or his brother fired the weapon that killed Collier but argued that both brothers were equally culpable in the officer's death. A graduate student at MIT, Nathan Harman, who was bicycling on campus the night of the murder, testified on Wednesday that he saw Tsarnaev leaning into the driver's side door of Collier's car, but did not see the older sibling. 'I only saw the one person,' said Harman, referring to Dzhokhar. 'He sort of snapped up, stood up and turned around, and he looked startled…And then I just didn't think anything of it and rode off.' Aftermath: A damaged white jersey, worn by Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jessica Kensky during the blast, is displayed to the media in a conference room after the conclusion of the day's session .

The court was also shown CCTV footage of Tsarnaev withdrawing $800 from an ATM using a credit card he had just stolen during a carjacking three days after the bombings . Harman said he assumed Tsarnaev was an MIT student. 'I remember thinking he had a big nose, but nothing beyond that really,' he said. Jurors also heard testimony on .

Other FBI agents on Tuesday described how some 3,000 pieces of evidence, including shrapnel and body parts, were retrieved from the blast sites near the marathon finish line, some on surrounding rooftops as high as four stories.

Prosecutors also presented shredded pieces of a black and white backpack that they contend 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, used to carry their homemade bombs. The FBI agent also told the court that investigators found shrapnel along with ball bearings, a zipper, shards of metal, small nails and duct tape in the aftermath of the explosion. A bombing survivor told the court earlier this week that the victims' injuries were difficult to heal and became infected because of the 'dirty' nature of the bombs packed with small pieces of metal. DeLair showed  a piece of wire collected amid the wreckage on Boylston Street on April 15, 2013. The wire, she testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, was part of one of the bomb's detonators. 'It's the part of the bomb that would make it go off,' DeLair said. She took pictures of the . dead and coordinated efforts to recover 'everything from human . remains to bomb components to parts of backpacks,' she said on Wednesday. Prosecutors resumed questioning the FBI agent on Wednesday, the . fifth day of the high-profile trial. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of killing three people and . injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs, as well as fatally . shooting a police officer three days later as he and his brother . tried to flee the city.

Boston, moments before his violent capture. The note accuses the United States government of killing . Muslims and says 'I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished'. It adds: 'I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in . Islam but due to said (...) it is allowed.' Words were missing . from the note due to bullet holes. Jurors were also presented with Tsarnaev's Twitter posts, . which ranged from jokes about girls, food, and homework, to . musings about Islam and a reference to the Sept. 11, 2001, . attacks on New York and Washington. After opening with three days of emotional and graphic testimony by witnesses including nine people injured in the attack, Tsarnaev's trial has moved into to a more technical phase as prosecutors show evidence about the bombs and communication between the two brothers. Despite the admission that opened the trial, Tsarnaev's not guilty plea stands, leaving it to the federal government to prove his guilt before the trial moves into a second phase, when the jury will determine whether to sentence him to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at Cheltenham Festival today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring. Although rural staples such as tweed, fur and Hunter wellies were present and correct, other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright Gloucestershire sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts, worn with knee-length boots. Print also proved a hit, with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat, boots and tights, while another opted for head-to-toe zebra print. Scroll down for video . Co-ordinating clothes: One woman showed off her love of leopard print, while another opted for a cosy fur coat and a little black dress . Country chic: A lady arrives wearing a neat blue suit (left) while others opt for cosy fur and classic tweed (centre and right) Short and sweet: Racegoers arrive dressed for a country party in a tweed mini (left) and a thigh-scraping leather number (right) Popular choice: Blue has proved particularly popular among racegoers this year, with the colour appearing in a variety of shades . Elegant: One lady opted for a neutral ensemble topped with a pheasant feather hat, while another teamed her yellow skirt suit with purple tights . Others, however, chose to take a more traditional approach to racing get-ups and were well-wrapped up against the biting March breeze as they flocked into the racecourse for the first day of racing action. Warm coats in an array of colourful hues proved particularly popular, with feather-festooned millinery used to ramp up the glamour along with opulent fur cuffs and collars. Blue appears to be an early contender in the racing season style stakes, with scores of ladies opting for the colour in a whole range of shades, from cornflower to cobalt. Whatever the colour, the vast majority appeared cheerful as they arrived to see the action on day one of what is one of the most prestigious events on the British racing calendar. Joining them was the first royal guest of the season, Zara Tindall, who cut a glamorous figure in a dark blue wool coat created especially for the royal by designer Paul Costelloe, a matching hat and oversized sunglasses. Tomorrow will see the 33-year-old joined at the Festival by her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, who has long been a racing enthusiast and is due to present a prize to the winner of the Queen Mother Champion Chase.

Despite the large royal contingent, the real highlight, on the track at least, is set to be Friday's Gold Cup, which will see veteran jockey AP McCoy make his final attempt at the classic race aboard Carlingford Lough. McCoy also featured in the first day's racing at Cheltenham and piloted the hotly-tipped Jezki, a dark bay six-year-old gelding, in the Stan James Champion Hurdle this afternoon. Unfortunately for McCoy, the race was taken by hot favourite Faugheen, with the Irish six-year-old battling home to give jockey Ruby Walsh his third winner of the day. Off the course, most of the entertainment came from Gloucestershire's increasingly fashionable style set, who had pulled out all the stops on a very sunny day one. With most eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots,  the race meeting is usually a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two.

Unlike Ascot - and from this year, Aintree - organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress. While fancy dress does creep in on St Patrick's Thursday, Gloucestershire's most fashionable tend to opt for a glamorous take on rural, with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante. Fur is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort unveiled by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned with pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite. Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie.

Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at this week's Cheltenham Festival. TODAY - CHAMPION HURDLE . HORSE: Faugheen . ODDS: 11/10 . He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. Worth a flutter: Faugheen, pictured here on the gallops yesterday, is a popular choice among punters betting on the Champion Hurdle . Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him. WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE . HORSE: Dodging Bullets . ODDS: 4/1 . All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting. THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE . HORSE: Saphir du Rheu . ODDS: 9/2 . Paul Nicholls' stranglehold at the top of the World Hurdle betting has tightened again following Rock on Ruby's withdrawal. It's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite, but with Saphir Du Rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing. Veteran: AP McCoy makes his way into the Cheltenham Festival for the very last time as a jockey . He gallops and jumps well, and his Cleeve Hurdle win shows he can do it at Cheltenham . FRIDAY - GOLD CUP . HORSE: Carlingford Lough . ODDS: 10/1 . It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy. Good work: Former Barclays banker Rich Richie (second right) celebrates with Ruby Walsh after his horse Faugheen triumphed . Celebrations: Ruby Walsh enjoyed his second victory of the day aboard Un De Sceaux in the Racing Post Arkle Challenge Trophy . Victory: Ruby Walsh celebrates as he steers Douvan to victory in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle - the first race of the day . Mingling: Mike Tindall was one of the more famous names to mingle with the crowds on the first day at Cheltenham . Showing their support: A Ruby Walsh mask gets pride of place next to two pints of Guinness . Bustling: The bright sunshine brought punters flocking to Cheltenham on the first day of racing action .

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-7-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It's one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar so it's no surprise that visitors to Cheltenham Festival are as well-heeled as it gets. Next week, crowds clad in fur and fancy hats will descend on the racecourse for four days of racing, champagne breakfasts and royal visitors. Among them will be the Duchess of Cornwall who is due to present the trophy to the winner of the  Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Wednesday. Prestigious: Cheltenham is one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar and attracts royalty . Glamorous: Cheltenham is famous for its glamorously dressed racegoers - none with fake tan . Chic: Unlike at other races were glamour reigns supreme, ladies at Cheltenham dress for the weather . But Camilla isn't the only glamorous attendee expected at the racecourse next week, with Zara Tindall, Princess Anne and Autumn Phillips among the event's famous fans. So who's who at Cheltenham? Femail reveals which royals and A-listers worth looking out for. CAMILLA, DUCHESS OF CORNWALL . The Duchess has long been a fan of all things equestrian and is an annual visitor to Cheltenham racecourse. Always impeccably, if cosily, dressed, last year saw her arrive on the arm of her food critic son, Tom Parker-Bowles. Royal visit: Camilla, seen here with son Tom Parker-Bowles at last year's event, will be at Cheltenham . Thumbs up: The Duchess of Cornwall is a keen racing fan and is a regular sight come race day . Presentation: Like last year, the Duchess will present one of the prizes on Ladies Day . Camilla, who is due to present a trophy on Ladies Day this year, spent most of the 2014 event ensconced in a box beside her son - and managed to bag a winner. The patron of three equine charities, The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club, the Duchess has been a rider all her life and used to hunt. Now confined to watching thanks to a painful back, she is almost as enthusiastic about racing as the Queen and last month attended her first race meet of the year when she joined soldiers for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup at Sandown. ZARA TINDALL . A professional rider in her own right, Zara Tindall, 33, is a familiar sight at the Cheltenham Festival, which she attends each year. Runner: This year's Cheltenham Festival will see Zara Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude take to the course . Familiar face: Zara, pictured at last year's event, attended every day of last year's Cheltenham Festival . All smiles: Zara, although an eventer herself, is also a National Hunt racing trainer . Royal approval: Princess Anne, a keen racing fan, is a regular visitor to the Cheltenham Festival . Last year, she was there every single day, bringing husband Mike on day one and spending the rest of the week watching the races alongside her mother, Princess Anne. Although a eventer by trade, Zara is also building up a reputation for training racehorses, most famously her husband's horse Monbeg Dude which competed in last year's Grand National. The horse, which managed a respectable seventh place finish in the event, is also expected to make an appearance at Cheltenham this year, with Zara and Mike set to cheer him on from the sidelines. Zara is also training a horse owned by her mother, who, along with Autumn Phillips, is also expected to be on the guest list at this year's festival. PIPPA MIDDLETON . The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister has become a regular visitor to UK sporting events, among them Wimbledon, Henley and, in 2013, Cheltenham. Looking good: Pippa Middleton proved she knows her way around a dress code when she visited . Big day out: The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who attended the 2013 event, failed to bag a winner . Sister act: The event also had a visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge the same year . Pictured enjoying the races in the company of Tom Kingston, Miss Middleton got the dress code, which encourages colour, spot on in her yellow coat. She topped off the look with a cosy fur hat in a style similar to the one worn by the Duchess of Cornwall a year later. CHANELLE MCCOY . The wife of top jockey AP McCoy, blonde Chanelle is a race day veteran and never puts a (well shod) foot wrong. Always there: Chanelle, the wife of champion jockey AP McCoy, is a familiar face at Cheltenham . Friends: Chanelle at Cheltenham with, left, Zara Tindall, and right, Emma Spencer . A close friend of Zara Tindall, the women were pictured sharing a joke during last year's Cheltenham Festival and were seen together again at Royal Ascot the following June. This year's event is set to be an emotional one for the 38-year-old, thanks to her husband's imminent retirement. McCoy, whose career has spanned more than 20 years, has ridden more than 4,000 winners, including victories in the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Although Chanelle has spoken of her fears for her husband's health in the past, she never fails to turn up to watch him race - always in a suitably glamorous ensemble. Wondering who to have a flutter on? Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at Cheltenham Festival. TUESDAY - CHAMPION HURDLE . HORSE: Faugheen . ODDS: 11/10 . He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him. WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE . HORSE: Dodging Bullets . ODDS: 4/1 . Possible winner? AP McCoy, pictured at last year's event, will run his final Gold Cup race next week . All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting. THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE . HORSE: Rock On Ruby . ODDS: 7/1 . Old-time favourite Rock On Ruby could make history to become just the third Champion Hurdle winner to also land the World Hurdle trophy. He's been jumping and travelling well, and after comprehensively beating Vaniteux back in January he's stamped his position as a serious contender to the younger guard. FRIDAY - GOLD CUP . HORSE: Carlingford Lough . ODDS: 10/1 . It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy. CAMILLA BASSETT-SMITH . Famous for her flamboyant taste in hats, TV presenter Camilla is a regular visitor to Cheltenham and is based in nearby Gloucester. Hat's a winner: TV presenter Camilla Bassett-Smith is famous for her fabulous hats . High-powered: Along with TV presenting, she is also a gold-medal winning gardener . Most of her work is for BBC Wiltshire, although she also boasts acting and modelling credits to her name. She is also a gold-medal winning gardener, who has shown her work at Chelsea among others, and was part of the production team at Gardener's World. To racing fans, however, she will always be the glamorous girl in the super-sized hats, with spectacular crimson, nude and chocolate numbers deployed in recent years. LYSTRA ADAMS . She's not a celebrity and she's certainly not a royal but to racing fans, Lystra Adams, an equine enthusiast from Staffordshire, has become a familiar sight. Bold choice: Lystra Adams at Cheltenham Festival in 2013, sporting an impressive crimson and black look . She's back! After wowing in crimson in 2013, Ms Adams returned wearing vibrant print the following year . That she has is largely due to her eccentric ensembles which are nearly always colourful and are, without fail, topped by a spectacular hat. Although Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood are also on her racing season itinerary, her flair for colour is particularly noticeable during visits to Cheltenham. Most impressive was her appearance on St Patrick's Thursday at last year's event, when she arrived clad head-to-toe in emerald green. Top choice: On St Patrick's Thursday 2014, Ms Adams wore emerald, topped with a peacock feather hat . While Aintree is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and Royal Ascot for its hats, the Cheltenham Festival has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing. Eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots, the race meeting offers a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two. Unlike Ascot, organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress. But perhaps a warning isn't required: Although the clothes donned by Gloucestershire's most fashionable might be rural, the looks on show certainly don't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante. Fur  is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort deployed by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite. Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie. But whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in Prince of Wales check, the Cheltenham Festival is just as stylish as its Berkshire counterpart. But not everyone pulls it off... Cheltenham Festival might have a fairly relaxed dress code  but most, with the March weather in mind, arrive sporting a take on practical glamour. But not everyone gets it right, with everything from thigh-scraping skirts to bizarre hats spotted in the parade ring. Should you need reminding, below are some of the worst offenders from last year. Remember ladies: just because it's tweed, doesn't mean it's classy. Oh dear: It might be tweed but in this case, the short-skirted look certainly isn't classy . Brrr! A patriotic Union Jack ensemble (left) and a shamrock embellished hat (right) Tally ho! A hunting inspired ensemble from 2014, complete with a pheasant feather hat and a pair of gauntlets . Short and sweet: Two 2014 racegoers chose to brave the chill in short skirts more suitable for summer .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-8-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs. A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa, tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks. Providing a unique glimpse in to life under ISIS' brutal and oppressive control, each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football, and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs. Militants: A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa (pictured), tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks . Dictats: Each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS . Each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets last month are numbered and dated, and are written in Arabic. It is understood the 32 fatwas are taken from approximately 70 new rules and regulations issued by the Islamic State in 2015. The letters are written in Arabic and address the city's population, which terror analysis website Jihadica claims proves they are meant for local use, not wider propaganda purposes. The fatwas are unlikely to have been issued by any body other than ISIS' official Sharia Council, to whom even leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reports. Jihadica claims that this means 30-year-old Bahraini scholar and council leader Turki al-Bin'ali is the likely author. Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets show that the list of new rules have been issued in a kind of stapled book and are structured in a question and answer format. Although they pieces of paper are dated using an official Islamic State calender, Jihadica converted the dates to show that they were issued to citizens between December and February this year. Oppressed: Among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under ISIS to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs . Horror: At times the fatwas make harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron . The fatwas issued by the Islamic State are highly bureaucratic, demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group's officials, insisting fighters cannot leave territory under ISIS control under any circumstances, and banning women from showing their eyes. At times they make for harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons. The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as when citizens are due compensation,  how women should ensure they are dressed, and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor. Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is  banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat. On a lighter note, both billiards and table football are allowed  - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that God does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits. Gambling on matches is, predictably, banned, but so is using table football characters shaped like humans, as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under ISIS' exceptionally strict interpretation of Islamic law. Fatwa 35: December 11, 2014 . One fifth of all war booty it is to be given to the office of war booty. Fatwa 36: December 11, 2014 . Tax should be levied on agricultural holdings that once belonged to apostates. Fatwa 37: December 16, 2014 . It is not permissible to travel to the lands of the unbelievers - including areas controlled by the Assad regime. Fatwa 38: December 2, 2014 . It permissible to curse  by accusing someone of being a disbeliever, but you must never say they are destined for hellfire. Fatwa 40: December 17, 2014 . Women should not wear make-up or show any part of their face, including their eyes, in case lures men into temptation. Fatwa 41: December 17, 2014 . Women can carry weapons such as Kalashnikov rifles under their robes providing they do not add definition to her body, luring men into temptation. Fatwa 42: December 17, 2014 . Female nurses must not work in an office with a male doctor unless they have a male guardian. Fatwa 43: December 17, 2014 . Women must see only female doctors for treatment. If a female doctor cannot be found, then it is permissible to see a male doctor, but on the condition that he not be alone with her. Fatwa 44: December 17, 2014 . Women must cover their entire body in thick, loose fitting material that does not resemble the clothing of men or that of women in the West. They must not slap their thighs or act flirtatiously as it is highly arousing, nor can they wear perfume. Fatwa 45: December 17, 2014 . A woman must travel with a male guardian at all times . Fatwa 46: December 17, 2014 . Women whose husbands have been killed must be punished if they try to leave ISIS-held territory for the lands of the unbelievers. Fatwa 47: December 18, 2014 . The length of time between the call to prayer and the call just before prayer must vary from prayer to prayer, according to the sunnah. Fatwa 48:  December 20, 2014 . You must not sell Islamic State passports to allow citizens to travel to the land of unbelievers. Fatwa 49:  December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play billiards providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, or inhibit the worshiping or God . Fatwah 50: December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play foosball [table football] providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, feature characters in human or animal form, or inhibit the worshiping or God. Brutal: The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as how women should dress and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor . Fatwa: Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' One chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that ISIS operates an organ harvesting scheme. 'It is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a Muslim, in order to save the latter's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs,' the letter states . 'The jurists of the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Islamic law, among others, permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life-saving measure. The case of organ transplantation as a life-saving measure is similar,' it adds. 'Moreover, it is established that the lives and organs of apostates are fundamentally licit. Their organs may thus be taken, whether or not the apostates are alive or already dead, and whether or not doing so results in their death,' it goes on to claim. AK-47 assault rifles, one fatwa insists, are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women's clothes, providing it doesn't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men. Likewise all forms of Western clothing are banned in order not to 'imitate the unbeliever', although the fatwas still feel the need to say it is illegal to sell counterfeit brand-name clothing and household products, as selling fake produce is a form of deceit. One surprising law bans the practice of men swapping sisters or daughters for brides of their own, apparently because it 'does an injustice to the bride'. Instead, ISIS demand, the bride must grant permission for any marriage to take place. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Photos of US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert meeting with the country's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist. Lippert is recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul, and was able to meet with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld as well as members of South Korea's ruling and opposition parties. Police are charging the activist, Kim Ki-jong, 55, with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Lippert, at a forum about reunification, prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador's tendons and nerves. Scroll down for video . Recovering: US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, (left), meets with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld following an attack by a knife-wielding activist who slashed the envoy's face and arm . Hospital visits: Photos of Lippert meeting with politicians including opposition leader Moon Jae-In (left) emerged on Sunday as the ambassador was recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul . On the mend: Leaders from the ruling Saenuri party met with Lippert on Sunday as authorities work to investigate activist attacker Kim Ki-jong . North Korean state media said the attack was 'deserved punishment'. Lippert, 42, is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Kim was detained on Friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home, some of which were pro-North Korea, according to Yonhap News. Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against Kim Ki-jong, who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Having material in support of Pyongyang is not illegal, but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the South. Authorities plan on charging Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government, was being considered. The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. While the North seemed to praise the attacks in its previous comments, its Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Sunday that linking the slashing to its government was part of an 'anti-DPRK smear campaign'. In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly attacked  Lippert before he gave a speech at a breakfast meeting. Above, the anti-US demonstrator being taken into custody on Thursday . Aftermath:  Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries, which include slashing wounds and nerve damage . Kim, who has a long history of anti-US protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual US-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the US presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops on the peninsula, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before:  Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong US military presence.

Divided peninsula: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left . Stained: Police say the ambassador was about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . The attack raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation would show up for the group's breakfast meeting, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . US ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Middle East. Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's attack reflected the South Korean people's protests against the US for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. US Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the US 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Security: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . Protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth in Korea and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. An elderly man offered dog meat to the recovering ambassador, but it was rejected because of hospital safety rules. Canine meat is thought to help heal wounds and is commonly offered to surgery patients. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership.</div></td></tr><tr>

Biden also spoke at the event, remarking that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' The president said today that he he hoped the institute could help restore confidence in government at a time of great cynicism, giving a young student a chance to debate in its full-scale replica of the Senate chamber. 'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked. 'What if our politics, our democracy, were as elevated as he envisions it to be?' Obama said. Instead, the president said citizens are cynical about government and disgusted by politicians' trivial pursuits and grandstanding for 'cameras instead of colleagues.'

Former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, the son of Ted Kennedy, sits next to former presidential hopeful John McCain during the dedication ceremony . 'Fear so permeates our politics instead of hope. People fight to get in the Senate only to get afraid,' the president told some 1,800 Kennedy friends, family and politicians from both parties gathered for the dedication. He said Kennedy was never afraid to compromise with Republicans, even if it would anger his supporters. Speaker after speaker spoke of Kennedy's outsized influence on the Senate, where he served for 47 years, and held his consensus-building up in contrast to the gridlock that has become the hallmark of the modern Congress. 'No one made the Senate come alive like Ted Kennedy,' Obama said. 'It was one of the great pleasures of my life to hear Ted Kennedy deliver one of his stem winders on the Floor.' Then an Illinois senator, Obama served in the upper chamber with Kennedy for roughly three and a half years before vacating office in preparation for his move to the White House. Kennedy backed Obama for the Oval Office in 2008 over fellow senator Hillary Clinton of New York, comparing him in a speech to his brother John F. Kennedy, another young politician who ignored suggestions within the political class that he wait his turn in line and was successfully elected president. The influential senator died the following year in August of 2009 several months after Obama took office. Known as the 'Lion of the Senate,' Kennedy held his position as statesman in the U.S. Senate for nearly 50 years.

Kennedy III, Amy Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy . Patrick Kennedy, Amy Kennedy and her daughter Harper Petitgout are seen inside the debating hall at the new centre, which is a full-scale replica of the U.S. senate . Obama praised Kennedy on Monday for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was on hand Monday for the event. It was 'common ground, not rooted in abstractions or stubborn, rigid ideologies, but shared experience, that led Ted and John McCain to work on a Patient’s Bill of Rights, and to work to forge a smarter, more just immigration system,' the president said. 'A common desire to fix what’s broken. A willingness to compromise in pursuit of a larger goal. A personal relationship that lets you fight like heck on one issue, and shake hands on the next -- not through just cajoling or horse-trading or serenades, but through Ted’s brand of friendship and kindness, and humor and grace.' McCain remembered Kennedy's 'zest for political argument' and said they would often laugh together after fighting on the Senate floor. He said the Senate hasn't been the same without him. ' That's mostly for reasons unrelated to losing Ted, but I have no doubt the place would be a little more productive and a lot more fun if he were there,' McCain added. Vice President Joe Biden said that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' when he arrived at the U.S. senate, and helped him into assignments usually not given to such junior politicians .

The afternoon included a performance by the Boston Pops Orchestra, as conductor Keith Lockhart (left) and Brian Stokes Mitchell (right) got into the swing of things . 'I miss fighting with him to be honest. It's gotten harder to find people who enjoy a good fight as much as Ted did,' he said to laughter. Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Kennedy in the Senate as well, said he 'treated me like a little brother.' When Biden first arrived in 1973, Kennedy helped him land choice committee assignments not generally available to freshmen senators. Biden said Kennedy introduced him around the Senate and was a master at generating trust and mutual respect. 'All politics is personal,' Biden said. 'No one in my life understood that better than Ted Kennedy.' Former Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott noted the irony of his inclusion on the institute's board of directors, along with former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi,' said Lott, to laughter and applause, 'is proud to be here today.' Lott said although the two disagreed and had 'some fiery discussions,' they came together sometimes in a bipartisan way. Lott recalled after he worked with Kennedy on an immigration bill that lost on a procedural vote in 2007, he told him, 'Ted, every time I work with you I get in trouble man.' Trent Lott (centre, flanked by Tom Daschle, left, and Ted Kennedy Jr, right) gave an amusing speech in which he joked: 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi, is proud to be here today' Ted Kennedy Jr, sentaor for Connecticut, speaks about his father at the opening of the Ted Kennedy centre .

Kennedy's widow, Victoria Kennedy, said her late husband hoped the institute would honor the nearly 2,000 who have served there and inspire future senators. She said he wanted visitors to feel the awe of walking into the chamber. Guests, including student groups, will be able to role-play as senators and debate some of the major issues of the day. The facility also includes a re-creation of Kennedy's Senate office, virtually unchanged from how it appeared when he died. 'He believed in the majesty of the place and its ability to inspire,' she said. A full-scale replica of the U.S. Senate Chamber is displayed inside the Edward M.

The Kennedys came out in full force on Monday to celebrate the memory of their late family member. Among the event's attendees were Jean Kennedy, the sister of Ted Kennedy, and former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Ted's son. Joan Kennedy, Ted Kennedy's first wife, was also present at the event, as well as Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy - brother to Ted - and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and journalist Maria Shriver. Shriver is a niece of the Kennedy family. Her mother, Eunice, was the sister of Ted.

Burmese men are being kept in cages on a tiny Indonesian island and forced to fish - or risk being kicked, beaten and whipped with stingray tails. Seafood caught by the slaves is entering major supply networks in the US with tainted produce appearing in sushi, canned pet food and bags of frozen fish, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Slaves are being locked up in cages on a tropical Indonesian island and forced to catch fish which ends up in US supply chains . Workers in Benjina, Indonesia, load fish onto a cargo ship bound for Thailand. Seafood caught by slaves mixes in with other fish at a number of sites in Thailand, including processing plants . The Associated Press says the men were brought to the village of Benjina through Thailand and the fish they are forced to catch is shipped back to Thailand before entering the global commerce stream. It claims tainted fish can wind up in the supply chains of some of America's major grocery stores, such as Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway; the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart; and the biggest food distributor, Sysco. It can also find its way into the supply chains of some of the most popular brands of canned pet food, including Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. There are also suggestions it can turn up as calamari at fine dining restaurants, as imitation crab in a California sushi roll or as packages of frozen snapper relabeled with store brands that land on dinner tables. In a year-long investigation, the AP interviewed more than 40 current and former slaves in Benjina. It charted the journey of a single large shipment of slave-caught seafood from the Indonesian village, including squid, snapper, grouper and shrimp, and tracked it by satellite to a Thai harbor. Upon its arrival, journalists followed trucks that loaded and drove the seafood over four nights to dozens of factories, cold storage plants and the country's biggest fish market. Captive: A security guard talks to detainees inside a cell at the compound of a fishing company in Benjina, Indonesia . Locked up: The men are forced to work 22-hour shifts or risk being kicked, beaten and whipped with stingray tails . Some fishermen, risking their lives, begged reporters for help. 'I want to go home. We all do,' one Burmese slave called out over the side of his boat, a cry repeated by many men. 'Our parents haven't heard from us for a long time, I'm sure they think we are dead.' Their catch mixes in with other fish at numerous sites in Thailand, including processing plants. US Customs records show that several of those Thai factories ship to America. They also ship to Europe and Asia, but the Associated Press traced shipments to the US, where trade records are public. The major corporations identified by AP declined interviews but issued statements that strongly condemned labor abuses. Many described their work with human rights groups to hold subcontractors accountable. National Fisheries Institute spokesman Gavin Gibbons, speaking on behalf of 300 US seafood firms that make up 75 percent of the industry, said his members are troubled by the findings. 'It's not only disturbing, it's disheartening because our companies have zero tolerance for labor abuses,' he said. 'These type of things flourish in the shadows.' The slaves interviewed by the AP described 20 to 22-hour shifts and unclean drinking water. Almost all said they were kicked, beaten or whipped with toxic stingray tails if they complained or tried to rest. They were paid little or nothing. An investigation suggests seafood caught by the slaves is ending up in major supply networks in the US with tainted produce appearing in sushi, canned pet food and bags of frozen fish . A refrigerated cargo ship called the Silver Sea Line,  second from right, is docked at Thajeen Port in Thailand, 15 days after it set sail from Benjina, Indonesia with a load of wild-caught seafood . Runaway Hlaing Min said many died at sea. 'If Americans and Europeans are eating this fish, they should remember us. There must be a mountain of bones under the sea,' he said. 'The bones of the people could be an island, it's that many.' In the small harbor in the village is a five-story office compound which includes the cage with the slaves, AP reports. At the Benjina port, the AP interviewed slaves from a dozen fishing vessels offloading their catch into a large refrigerated cargo ship, the Silver Sea Line. The ship belonged to the Silver Sea Reefer Co., which is registered in Thailand and has at least nine refrigerated cargo boats. The company said it is not involved with the fishermen. 'We only carry the shipment and we are hired in general by clients,' said company owner Panya Luangsomboon. 'We're separated from the fishing boats.' AP followed that ship, using satellite tracking over 15 days to Samut Sakhon, Thailand, and journalists watched as workers packed the seafood over four nights onto more than 150 trucks, following deliveries to factories around the city. Slaves from Myanmar lean over the deck of their fishing trawler. Many of the men were brought to the village of Benjina through Thailand . Frozen seafood is off-loaded from a refrigerated 3,000-ton cargo ship in Thailand.  The ship belongs to the Silver Sea Reefer Co. but the company said it is not involved with the slave fishermen . Inside those plants, representatives said they sold seafood to other Thai processors and distributors. US Customs bills of lading identify specific shipments from those plants to American firms, including well-known brand names. For example, one truck bore the name and bird logo of Kingfisher Holdings Ltd., which supplies frozen and canned seafood around the world. Another truck went to Mahachai Marine Foods Co., a cold storage business that also supplies Kingfisher, according to Kawin Ngernanek, whose family runs it. 'Yes, yes, yes, yes,' said Kawin, who also serves as spokesman for the Thai Overseas Fisheries Association. 'Kingfisher buys several types of products.' When later asked about abusive labor practices, Kawin was not available. Instead, Mahachai Marine Foods manager Narongdet Prasertsri responded: 'I have no idea about it at all.' Kingfisher did not answer repeated requests for comment. Every month, Kingfisher and its subsidiary KF Foods Ltd. sends about 100 metric tons of seafood from Thailand to America, according to US Customs records. Slaves use this warehouse in Benjina as a makeshift dormitory after finishing shifts that last up to 22 hours . Workers from Myanmar load fish onto a Thai-flagged cargo ship in Benjina, Indonesia. An investigation has suggested seafood caught by the slaves is ending up on plates across America . Maung Soe of Myanmar holds up a copy of the seafarer's book given to him before he boarded a Thai fishing trawler, in Benjina, Indonesia . Tun Lin Maung sits with a group of slave fishermen from Myanmar behind a fishing company building. He says it has been two years since he escaped from the fishing trawler he was working on . These shipments have gone to Stavis Seafoods, a Boston-based Sysco supplier, and other distributors. 'The truth is, these are the kind of things that keep you up at night,' said CEO Richard Stavis, whose grandfather started the company. He said his business visits international processors, requires notarized certification of legal practices and uses third-party audits. 'There are companies like ours that care and are working as hard as they can,' he said. A similar pattern repeats itself with other companies and shipments. The AP followed another truck to Niwat Co., where part owner Prasert Luangsomboon said the company sells to Thai Union Manufacturing. Weeks later, when confronted about forced labor in their supply chain, Niwat referred several requests for comment to Luangsomboon, who could not be reached for further comment. Thai Union Manufacturing Co. is a subsidiary of Thai Union Frozen Products PCL., Thailand's largest seafood corporation, with $3.5billion in annual sales. This parent company, known simply as Thai Union, owns Chicken of the Sea and is buying Bumble Bee, although the AP did not observe any tuna fisheries. Thai Union says its direct clients include Wal-Mart, and ships thousands of cans of cat food to the U.S. every month, including household brands like Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. These end up on shelves of major grocery chains, such as Kroger, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as pet stores. Hla Phyo stands next to a grave marker of a man he helped bury - a Burmese fisherman slave who died on a fishing boat - at a cemetery in Benjina . A group of former slaves from Myanmar, who worked on fishing ships, walk in the densely forested interior of an island in the Arafura Sea after escaping from Benjina . Free: A former slave  from Myanmar, who goes by the name Mozet (centre) is one of those who escaped or ran away while trawlers were docked at the Benjina port . Again, however, it's impossible to tell if a particular can of cat food might have slave-caught seafood. Thai Union said it takes multiple stakeholders to eradicate labor abuses. 'We all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100 percent clean,' Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in an emailed statement. The enslaved fishermen on Benjina had no idea where the fish went, only that it was too valuable for them to eat. Their desperation was palpable. A crude cemetery holds more than 60 graves strangled by tall grasses and jungle vines. The small wooden markers are neatly labeled, some with the falsified names of slaves and boats. Only their friends remember where they were laid to rest. In the past, former slave Hla Phyo said, supervisors on ships simply tossed bodies into the sea to be devoured by sharks. But after authorities and companies started demanding that every man be accounted for on the roster upon return, captains began stowing corpses alongside the fish in ship freezers until they arrived back in Benjina. 'I'm starting to feel like I will be in Indonesia forever,' said Phyo, wiping a tear away. 'I remember thinking when I was digging, the only thing that awaits us here is death.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-13-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the enlisted U.S. soldier who left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later ransomed from an Islamist extremist network by the Obama administration for five Taliban leaders, was charged with desertion and 'misbehavior before the enemy' buy the U.S. Army on Wednesday. But he won't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty.' The level of that charge the Pentagon levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term. The other charge, however, 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place,' could send him to a military prison for life. The Uniform Code of Military Justice describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . CHARGED: An Army officer announced the formal criminal complaint against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Wednesday . Bergdahl, a US Army sergeant who was swapped in 2014 for five high-value Taliban leaders, has been charged with desertion and will face a military court martial, according to reports on Wednesday . President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . SOLDIER: Bergdahl was an Army private when he was captured, but the Pentagon restored his rank upon his release to what it would have been – sergeant – if he had remained on active duty, and paid him more than $200,000 in back wages . In addition to a potential life sentence, punishments for the crimes Bergdahl was charged with include a dishonorable discharge from the Army, a reduction in rank all the way down to 'E-1' – the lowest level of enlisted personnel – and forfeiture of all of his military pay. An Army spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at Fort Bragg in North Carolina that the next step in the procedure would be an 'article 32' hearing at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. That's where Bergdahl remains on active duty, and will remain unless he's convicted. An article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system. Its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post in Paktika province, Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about America's mission there. The Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based network of Islamists aligned with the Taliban regime, took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years. A deal brokered by the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar brought him home, but at the cost of releasing the Taliban insurgents from the military prison complex at Guantanamo, Cuba. Two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the West when their Qatar-imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over. A government official meanwhile told Fox News that three of the men have already tried to 're-engage' with their old networks, and one was 'trying to provide advice, council or inspiration' to his former terror network. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . The Pentagon was set to announce a decision in the case Wednesday afternoon at Fort Bragg, N.C., but the White House insisted it was in the dark. 'I'm not aware of any plans for them to do that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily press briefing, after Daily Mail Online asked him for comment on the looming Pentagon press conference. 'But this is a process that's being run by the United States Army,' Earnest added. 'So I'd direct you to the Pentagon for an answer.' A Pentagon official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement after the Army's announcement that 'every American is innocent until proven guilty, and we all wanted to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home.' 'But my chief concern remains President Obama’s decision to release five hardened terrorists, with no guarantees that they won’t return to the battlefield. I believe it made Americans less safe.' Bergdahl's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy, but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180-degree turn. Last year after Bergdahl came home, National Security Adviser Susan Rice claimed he had served his country 'with honor and distinction.' But in the days before his then-mysterious disappearance in 2009, he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts. 'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong,' he wrote, according to Rolling Stone magazine. 'I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be American.' Bergdahl's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read: 'OBEY YOUR CONSCIENCE!' The Fox News Channel reported in 2014 that Bergdahl's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life – and that he intended to renounce his citizenship. 'TALIBAN FIVE': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . PROOF OF LIFE: Bergdahl's captors released a video on July 19, 2009 showing him with his head shaven, and showing his military 'dog tag' ID to the camera . Gen. Mark Milley, the commanding officer at Fort Bragg, has been leading the inquest into the Bergdahl case. The U.S. Army's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove Bergdahl never intended to return to his combat unit. Desertion itself can carry a death sentence, but only in the most serious of cases. That penalty hasn't been levied on a U.S. servicemember since 1944. The Pentagon has broad discretion and can charge soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels. Bergdahl's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the Pentagon's announcement. The Washington Post reported that Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's attorney, said his client was handed his 'charge sheet' Wednesday at Fort Bragg. President Barack Obama attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced, especially from Bergdahl's former platoonmates – who insisted he deserted them and their mission. One of them, Cody Full, told a congressional committee in June 2014 that Bergdahl could – and should – be court martialed on eight separate charges, including disobeying orders and 'misconduct' as a prisoner. BALLET BOWE: Bergdahl was a classical dancer from the age of 16 or 17, studying at the Sun Valley Ballet School before he enlisted in the Army . SWAP: The Army opened an investigation into Bergdahl's 'capture' almost immediately after his release, shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange (Bergdahl is 3rd right, back to the camera) TEMPORARY: Jubilant signs and American flags went up overnight in the Bergdahls' hometown of Hailey, Idaho – but were largely taken down as the circumstances of Bowe's capture made the news. Most of the backlash against the president, however, came from Congress – which wasn't given 30 days' notice about the 'Taliban 5' being transferred out of Guantamo Bay. A federal law requires such notice. The House of Representatives later approved a resolution condemning Obama for breaking the law, with 22 Democrats breaking ranks to agree. 'By setting free five top Taliban commanders from U.S. custody, the Obama administration made Americans less safe,' Speaker John Boehner said then. Obama defended his actions in a June 2014 joint press conference in Brussels, Belgium with British Prime Minister David Cameron, just a few days after Bergdahl was released into U.S. custody. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' the president said then, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody's child and that we don't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.' 'We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated, and we were deeply concerned about [him],' Obama told reporters about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.' Administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked. Separately, the parents of an Army lietenant who died while searching for Bergdahl months after he walked away from his platoon told Daily Mail Online that the Pentagon 'lied' to them about the circumstances of their son's death. Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews perished in September 2009, and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a Taliban commander. Once Bergdahl was released, they were told the truth. 'It's a big cover-up like Benghazi,' Andrews' father said three days after Bergdahl's release, 'just like everything Obama has done.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Sure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television. With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkajärvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkajärvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper’s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves.

A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It’s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than €250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey’s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you’d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they’re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair. VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The National Collegiate Athletics Association is worried about holding the Final Four – one of the nation's biggest college sporting events – in Indianapolis, after Indiana's governor signed a 'religious freedom' bill into law that gay rights activists say is a license to discriminate. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA, said Thursday that the governing body for college sports is 'especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.' The Final Four, an annual culmination of the national men's college basketball tournament, is slated to be held next week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, a city where the NCAA itself is based. The new statute, the first of its kind passed this year, invalidates state and local laws that 'substantially burden' the ability of people – including businesses and associations – to follow their religious beliefs . Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, supported the bill as it moved through the state legislature and was passed by wide margins in both chambers. He signed it in a private ceremony Thursday morning. Pence is considering whether to enter the 2016 presidential race, but is considered an outsider with long odds at success. STUMBLE? Future FInal Four appearances in Indianapolis could be in jeopardy because of a new religious-freedom law that Indiana gay rights activists saw is a license to discriminate . CALM DOWN! Indiana Gov. Mike Pence addressed the new statute in a news conference at the Statehouse in Indianapolis on Thursday . NO MEANS NO? Indiana's staet government won't be able to force bakeries run by evangelical Christians to provide wedding cakes for same-sex couples under the new law . There's no indication the NCAA has any plans to relocate the Final Four this year – ticketing and promotions have been underway for more than six months – but the event is scheduled to return to Indianapolis in 2021 and the NCAA is hinting that it might bolt the Hoosier State. 'We will work diligently to assure student-athletes competing in, and visitors attending, next week's Men's Final Four in Indianapolis are not impacted negatively by this bill,' Emmert said. 'Moving forward, we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.' An online push for the NCAA to react to the bill began earlier this week, carrying the hashtag #Final4Fairness. Former professional basketball player Jason Collins, the first openly gay athlete to play in the NBA, tweeted: '@GovPenceIN, is it going to be legal for someone to discriminate against me & others when we come to the #FinalFour?' A pressure group called the LGBT Sports Coalition asked Thursday for the NCAA, the Big Ten, the NFL, USA Diving and USA Gymnastics to pull their events from Indianapolis over the next 16 months. The Big Ten holds its football championship game in at Lucas Oil Field and has a contract to remain there until 2021. The conference also is scheduled to hold its men's basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis in 2020 and 2022. The Big Ten women's basketball tournament is set to be held in Indianapolis for six years beginning in 2017. The NFL also holds its draft combine at Lucas Oil Stadium every year. Indiana's largest city is also hoping to land the 2019 Super Bowl. Pence said in a statement Thursday that the new law, patterned after a federal law signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, ensures 'religious liberty is fully protected.' 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion, but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,' he said. Reaction to the decision was swift and divided. Indiana Right to Life President and CEO Mike Fichter praised the new law, saying it would give abortion opponents legal recourse if they are pressured to support the procedure. The organization circulated an online petition to thank Pence for signing the bill. FINAL FORGET-IT: Look for gay-rights protests next week when the Final Four comes to Indiana's largest sports arena, Lucas Oil Stadium . MIXED REACTIONS: A window sign on a downtown Indianapolis florist shows its owner's objection to the Religious Freedom bill passed by the Indiana legislature . Freedom Indiana, the gay rights group that led a successful 2014 fight against efforts to add a gay marriage ban to the state constitution, called it 'a sad day for Indiana,' saying Pence and lawmakers ignored concerns of thousands of Indiana residents. 'We made it clear that this law will only be used to harm other Hoosiers, and that's not the Indiana way. The lawmakers didn't listen. The governor didn't listen,' the group said in a statement. ON DECK: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he'll sing a similar law if his state's legislature passes it . At least two groups – the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Gen Con – have said they would reconsider plans to hold their conventions in Indianapolis because of the legislation. Gen Con is a videogaming convention that drew 56,000 people – most of them young – last year, making it the city's largest convention in both economic impact and attendance numbers. The CEO of the California technology company Salesforce told the Indianapolis Business Journal his company would reduce its investment in the state, specifically because of the new law. Supporters say discrimination concerns are overblown and that the Indiana measure merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide services like catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. They note that similar laws are already on the books in 19 states. Last year, Mississippi enacted its own religious freedom law just weeks after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, vetoed a similar effort there amid criticism from large corporations concerned about its impact on doing buiness in the state. 'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it,' Pence said Thursday. 'For more than 20 years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana.' Chad Griffin, national president of the Human Rights Campaign, held his own press conference with one anchored by Hutchinson, the Arkansas governor . COUNFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS: Republican Jan Brewer, then Arizona's governor, vetoed a similar bill in 2014 before leaving office . The nation's political climate is vastly different from what President Clinton saw in 1993, however: The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this year on whether gay marriage bans violate the U.S. Constitution. The Indianapolis chamber of commerce opposed the bill on the grounds that it could make it more difficult to attract top companies and employees. Similar bills have been advancing this year in the Arkansas and Georgia legislatures. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Thursday that if his state's lawmakers send the bill to his desk, he'll sign it into law. 'I think it's a bill that puts a high priority on religious freedom and recognizes that as a part of the balance,' Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference after Pence signed his state's bill. Elsewhere at the state Capitol in Little Rock, Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin told journalists that the legislative push 'is a concerted effort by a hateful political faction to say that Arkansas does not welcome all its citizens, sending a clear message that this state is not open for business – and all this is happening on Gov. Hutchinson's watch. Griffin's organization is America's wealthiest and most powerful gay rights group. The latest changes to the Arkansas bill, tweaked on Wednesday night, give liberal lobbyists some ground by agreeing that complying with federal law counts as a 'compelling government intetest.' But Griffin said Thursday that his group wasn't satisfied. 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig,' he said. Indiana GOvernor Mike Pence . Pence delivered a brief statement during a news conference on Thursday, after signing the controversial bill into law: . 'Today I signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier of every faith. 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action. 'One need look no further than the recent litigation concerning the Affordable Care Act. A private business and our own University of Notre Dame had to file lawsuits challenging provisions that required them to offer insurance coverage in violation of their religious views. 'Fortunately, in the 1990s Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—limiting government action that would infringe upon religion to only those that did not substantially burden free exercise of religion absent a compelling state interest and in the least restrictive means. 'Last year the Supreme Court of the United States upheld religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action. At present, nineteen states—including our neighbors in Illinois and Kentucky—have adopted Religious Freedom Restoration statutes. And in eleven additional states, the courts have interpreted their constitutions to provide a heightened standard for reviewing government action. 'In order to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law, this year our General Assembly joined those 30 states and the federal government to enshrine these principles in Indiana law, and I fully support that action. 'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it. In fact, it does not even apply to disputes between private parties unless government action is involved. For more than twenty years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana. 'Indiana is rightly celebrated for the hospitality, generosity, tolerance, and values of our people, and that will never change. Faith and religion are important values to millions of Hoosiers and with the passage of this legislation, we ensure that Indiana will continue to be a place where we respect freedom of religion and make certain that government action will always be subject to the highest level of scrutiny that respects the religious beliefs of every Hoosier of every faith.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The first video of Mohammed Emwazi - identified last week as ISIS executioner Jihadi John - has emerged . The first footage of ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged. The video shows Mohammed Emwazi, identified last week as the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football. The previously-unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi was educated. The friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of Emwazi before he became the ISIS's depraved executioner-in-chief. In the film, obtained by Channel 4 News, the 'football mad' teenager, thought to be around 15 at the time, is  the second person to be chosen for the team. One of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting 'Emwazi', beckoning over the future jihadi. But he also appears to be painfully shy, instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him. Channel 4 News said Emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time. The footage, filmed in May 2004, was broadcast this evening, after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother. According to a former friend of his brother Omar, Emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008, while he was living on the notorious Mozart estate in west London. After viewing the footage, Diane Foley, the mother of American journalist James Foley, told Jon Snow it was 'frightening' that a 'promising young person who had many gifts' could use his talents for 'such evil'. She said: 'It's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate. That's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate?' She added that the fact Jihadi John had been identified did not help to bring her closure. She said: 'If it had not been that young man, then I'm afraid it would have been someone else. I think it's tragic for that young man and his family - it's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality.' Since being identified, Emwazi has emerged as a fun-loving young boy, who adored The Simpsons, Playstation games and eating chips. He was also said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30. Scroll down for video . The video shows Emwazi, aged around 15, being chosen by a captain to join the team for a game of football . The footage, which is the first time any moving image has been obtained of Emwazi, was shot in the playground of Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in Queen's Park . In a handwritten entry in his primary school yearbook, the Kuwaiti-born British citizen, who moved to the UK aged six, wrote: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer'. The entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world's most wanted man, who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of Islam. But, a decade later, Emwazi had shunned British life and was a 'known wolf' to MI5, having already taken the path towards becoming ISIS' most notorious murderer. In a chilling twist, in a school yearbook from when he was 10, Emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game 'Duke Nukem: Time To Kill' and his favourite book as 'How To Kill A Monster' from the popular children's Goosebumps series. He also lists his favourite band as pop group S Club 7, and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30, writes: 'I will be in a football team and scoring a goal.' Emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue, his favourite animal as a monkey, his favourite cartoon as The Simpsons and chips as his favourite food. Earlier this week, it emerged Emwazi was bullied as a schoolboy at the school in which the film was made. Emwazi, pictured as a schoolboy, was said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30 . The terrorist has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab . Former headteacher Jo Shuter told Radio 4's Today programme: 'He had adolescent issues. Particularly at that age, for the boys, it is a time when the hormones start raging, and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with. 'By the time he got into the sixth-form he was, to all intents and purposes, a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted to go to.' After arriving in Britain when he was six years old, the  extremist appeared to embrace British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. He had moved to Britain in 1993, settling in the north-west London suburbs of Maida Vale and Queens Park. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. The footage was filmed at Quintin Kynaston Academy School in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi attended secondary school and was said to have been bullied . He was also described as 'calm and decent' and 'the best employee we ever had' by  an IT firm for whom he worked in Kuwait. But, at some point during his lifetime, Emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of MI5. It emerged today that the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK. The 26-year-old a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command. He had been watched by the services since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab. Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain. En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab. Emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He alleged an agent from MI5 knew 'everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with' and claimed the organisation attempted to 'turn' him to work for them. By Arthur Martin for The Daily Mail . The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi . Jihadi John’s family are being guarded by armed police at a secret location in a security operation costing taxpayers more than £5,000 a day. Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command provide round-the-clock protection for the Islamic State killer’s mother, brother and three of his sisters. The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi. They initially left their £600,000 London flat, where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby. But when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21, was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names. They have been receiving an estimated £40,000 a year in benefits since they sought asylum in Britain in 1993. The family fled Kuwait after the first Gulf War, claiming persecution as they were seen to favour the Iraqi invasion in 1990. But after they were made British citizens Emwazi’s father Jasem, 51, returned to Kuwait – the country he claimed he fled fearing for his life. His daughter Asma, 25, is also there. Meanwhile Emwazi’s mother Ghaneya, brother and three of his sisters continue to drain the public purse of thousands more in protection costs. None are suspected of wrongdoing but police are thought to be questioning them about their contact with Emwazi since he moved to Syria. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public will be angry that the family are receiving such expensive protection, but added that the police are in an ‘impossible position’. They initially left their £600,000 London flat (pictured) where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby . Scotland Yard refused to comment on the family’s whereabouts or security arrangements. Friends of the family said Emwazi’s father moved close relatives into a safe house in Kuwait after his son’s identity was revealed. Last night a former friend of the terrorist said he once kidnapped two boys at gunpoint in retaliation for a gang attack on his brother. Emwazi forced the teenagers into a car and ordered them to strip to their underwear before dumping them on the M1 motorway. The kidnapping was said to be retribution for a vicious attack the previous day when Emwazi and his younger brother Omar were attacked with bricks. Then, when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21 (pictured) was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names . It occurred in 2008 when Emwazi was studying at the University of Westminster – a year before he was quizzed by the security services on suspicion of trying to reach militant training camps in Somalia. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said the attack was sparked by gang rivalries involving two West London estates. ‘There was a big fight,’ he said. ‘[Gang members] threw a brick at my head and broke my arm. Omar was punched in the face a few times and beaten up. ‘The next day Mohammed turned up with two religious guys with beards. They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. They dumped them on the M1.’</div></td></tr><tr>

Archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, which is at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network. Used from 1569 until at least 1738, including during the Great Plague in 1665, the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was situated in close proximity to Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe – and was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum. Scroll down for video . Skeletons of a mother and child (pictured above) are among those which are to be excavated from the Bedlam burial ground, which is the site for the new Liverpool Street station that will serve London's Crossrail network . Other skeletons at the burial site include that of a mother and her two children (above). Most of the remains are unidentified since the site did not keep its own burial records when it was used between 1569 and 1738 . Archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons (pictured) from the ancient Bedlam burial ground . These two adult skulls were among thousands uncovered at the Bedlam burial ground, which was used during the Great Plague in 1665. The remains will be removed over the next week by a team of archaeologists . A team of 60 archaeologists will work in shifts, six days a week, to excavate the skeletons and gather any other remains at the burial site. The skeletons (pictured above) will then be reburied on consecrated ground . The site, which was uncovered by Crossrail workers who are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial ground, is thought to contain the remains of a former lord mayor of London, a notorious criminal and political activists. The skeletons will be excavated over the next four weeks by a team of 60 archaeologists who will work in shifts, six days a week. They will carefully remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. After the excavation, the workers will then dig through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site, which has already yielded several interesting Roman artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns. The skeletons will then be reburied on consecrated ground. Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall by contractor Laing O'Rourke. Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners. 'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' Archaeologists at the new Livepool Street station (pictured) are expected to finish on site in September . The remains were uncovered during Crossrail construction work, which is set to be completed by 2019 . Bones and skeletal remains could be seen at the Bedlam burial site today as workers began excavating them . The Bedlam burial ground opened during London’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th Century . The burial site was the first in London which was not associated with a parish church and so many remains are unknown. Workers could be seen carrying out excavations at the site today ahead of the Crossrail work . The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year . The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. Bedlam burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of the plague and other epidemics. As well as being used to bury those who were struck down with disease, it also became the site for those who passed away at the nearby Bethlem Royal Hospital - which is thought to have been the world's first mental asylum. However, with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness, determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible for experts. Earlier this year, Crossrail-led research identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the site. Names include Sir Ambrose Nicholas, who was lord mayor of London in 1575, and Dr John Lamb (also known as Lam or Lambe), an astrologer and advisor to the First Duke of Buckingham. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of Londoners . To date, the Crossrail project has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. Pictured: Workers have started excavation work at the Bedlam site . The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology . Preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street station site have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons . Lamb was said to have been stoned to death by an angry mob outside a theatre in 1628 following allegations of rape and black magic. Others identified in the research, carried out by 16 invited volunteers, include victims of riots by 'Fanatiques', noted in the diaries of Samuel Pepys in January 1661. To date, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. Preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014 have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. After the skeletaon excavations, the workers will dig through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains . Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners.' Pictured: Excavations beneath Liverpool Street . An artist's impression of how the new Liverpool Street Crossrail station will look when it is completed . The Bedlam burial ground, also known as the New Churchyard, was situated near the notorious Bethlem Royal Hospital which opened during London’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th Century. The burial site was the first in London which was not associated with a parish church and it did not keep its own burial records. Instead, the City’s parish churches recorded which of their parishioners were buried at Bedlam in their own records. Bethlem Royal Hospital was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe . The graveyard, built on Bethlem Hospital’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the city started to overflow, was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum. Bethlem Royal Hospital, which quickly became pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners, was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station. By 1403, the majority of its patients suffered mental health issues. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia. Bedlam: The scene inside Bethlem Hospital, as depicted by William Hogarth in The Rake's Progress . Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally. Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds. Inside the single-storey building that housed 12 cells, a kitchen, staff accommodation and an exercise yard, inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a tourist attraction by Londoners who paid a penny to stare at them. Patients, usually poor, were given treatments including restraint, dousing with water, beatings and isolation. Conditions inside Bedlam were depicted by William Hogarth in his 18th century drawings A Rake’s Progress, charting the decline of a merchant’s son from wealthy heir to asylum inmate, via debtor’s jail. In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises. Bethlem moved again in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum. A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley. It is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Trendy winter coat manufacturer Canada Goose is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it, Daily Mail Online can disclose. The hugely successful maker of fur-lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers, exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built. The shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in Canada. The complaint has been filed by Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund and calls for independent law enforcement agency the Competition Bureau of Canada to 'investigate Canada Goose for its multiple intentional misrepresentations.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fashion forward: Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton is one of the many celebrities who have helped make Canada Goose the must-have winter brand . Caught: Campaigners claim coyotes trapped and skinned for their fur to trim the hoods of Canada Goose coats can be in pain for days. It is unclear whether these images are from Canada Goose trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds . Ugly: Exhausted, alone and all out of fight, this Coyote awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg . Fan following: Krysten Ritter models one of the coats with coyote fur-lined hoods. The brand is diversifying into other apparel too, such as the down jacket worn by Hugh Jackman (right) Endorsed: The company is marketed by British celebrity Ben Fogle, who presents Ben Fogle's Animal Clinic and has spoken out on other animal cruelty issues including the killing of rhinos and the killing of zoo animals . Canada Goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket, coats and parkas. They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market with worldwide sales topping $176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade. In November last year it opened its own store in West Chelsea, one of New York's most prestigious shopping areas, and it also sells at high-end stores such as Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman,, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus.. Earlier this year it opened a new factory in Toronto to cope with soaring demand. Celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed, down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite. Last year's Sports Illustrated cover featured Kate Upton wearing a Canada Goose jacket and little else. Other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included Hugh Jackman, the Wolverine star, and Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton. It is endorsed by Ben Fogle, the British animal television show presenter, who has also spoken out against animal cruelty. But according to the legal complaint, seen by Daily Mail Online, consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase Canada Goose. In the document Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund has accused the company of, 'engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur.' The complaint attacks Canada Goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained. Distressed: A coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by Canada Goose trappers . Snared: Campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die . Canada Goose's website claims that the company is 'deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals.' It goes on, 'We never purchase fur from fur farms, never use fur from endangered animals, and only purchase from certified Canadian trappers.' These trappers are governed by the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) and their pelts are purchased by Canada Goose through North American Fur Auctions (NAFA). According to Canada Goose the NAFA 'monitors very closely' the practices of the trappers selling through it. According to Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund it does nothing of the sort. Instead, they claim: 'There is no mechanism within the NAFA to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which NAFA accepts consignment pelts.' NAFA, it states, does not monitor trappers. It is not an oversight body; it is a commercial fur auction house. Nor does the AIHTS bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in Canada Goose's claims. The AIHTS simply requires Canada to 'phase out' certain types of traps – traps, Animal Justice Canada claims, that are still used by the trappers selling to Canada Goose. What Canada Goose says: The FAQs on the firm's website form part of the animal rights group's case against the successful manufacturer. They say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely . Design classic: Canada Goose's women's Trillium Coat in military green . In demand: The company predicts double digit sales growth for the foreseeable future . And so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a Canada Goose coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight, they are, Animal Justice Canada insists, being deceived. Coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures, severance of tendons and ligaments, severe bleeding, spinal cord injury, organ damage and amputation of limbs. Despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed, suffocated or strangled to death by the trapper.To dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt. Body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift 'humane' death implied in Canada Goose's marketing material. The Fur Institute of Canada, which promotes the interests of the fur industry, believes a 'humane' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds. According to Animal Justice Canada: '..under laboratory conditions, it takes approximately eight minutes … for a snare to strangle a coyote – three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane.' As for the company's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species, Animal Justice Canada points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture. Marketing: Canada Goose uses Canada's Arctic Circle to highlight the warmth of its jackets . More fans: Jodie Foster (left) keeps warm in a Canada Goose jacket while filming in New York, while Olivia Wilde wears one to run errands in the city . Key among Canada Goose's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in, 'the coldest places on Earth…fur is not just the best choice, but the only choice.' Speaking on their website, Danny Reis, the president and CEO of Canada Goose, explains: 'We use coyote fur for a number of reasons. Number one, coyote fur works. It's functional; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can. It does that in the coldest environments in earth, and it's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth.' We're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced, and people should know this is not something we take lightly. Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that. We also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position, it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes Canada Goose a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours. We are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in Canada, and of our continued role as an educator on this matter. The narrator then states: 'Coyote fur, unlike fake fur, doesn't hold moisture, retains heat and is biodegradable.' In its legal complaint Animal Justice Canada says: 'There is no scientific proof to support Canada Goose's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face, in a way that 'no synthetic material' can be.' This is not the first time Canada Goose has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners. Last year Daily Mail Online revealed that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals, 'in a way that is inherently cruel.' Speaking to Daily Mail Online then Lindsay Rajt, Director of Campaigns for PETA described the horrific reality of animal trapping. She said: 'The company's reference to AIHTS standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns. 'Leg hold traps are still legal in Canada. Mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young. The trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them. They are frightened and starving and in pain during that time. And then they're bludgeoned or strangled to death.' Additionally PETA has called for the company to replace its goose down – which is obtained as a by-product of the poultry industry - and opt for 'revolutionary synthetic technology' already used by competitor, North Face. But according to Ms Rajt PETA's repeated attempts to meet with Canada Goose have been stonewalled. Now, Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund, has called for the Competition Bureau to investigate the company for its 'multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website.' And it has urged the body to 'take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that Canada Goose is accountable' for the 'false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers.' Canada Goose said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur. A spokesman said: 'Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. 'Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that.'</div></td></tr><tr>

Not with David James, Phil Neville, Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon sharing their expertise and defensive acumen. Or maybe there’s the midfield craft of Steve McManaman, Paul Scholes, Owen Hargreaves and Jamie Redknapp. Or the striking instincts of Alan Shearer and Michael Owen. That’s a decent international team right there, boasting more than 500 caps and more than a hundred goals, even without Match of the Day host Gary Lineker. Or Gary Neville, one of a few England internationals from his generation involved in coaching, when his Sky TV duties allow. Holland beat England 2-0 in 1993 and almost all of the Dutch side are in coaching but not one player from England is in management... HOLLAND .

Wright: BBC broadcaster . Ian Wright  is dejected after England's hopes of reaching the World Cup in 1994 . Many former England stars have opted for the sofa. Who can blame them? Coaching is a vocation, an all-consuming passion; not something to dabble at in the hope of discovering you possess a magical gift. Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson have devoted their lives to it. Many top players from the previous generation were chewed up and spat out having been through the usual routine: use your name to get a job, discover it’s damn hard and totally different to being a player and either get disillusioned or sacked or both. Soon the name doesn’t open doors because you’re no longer a star footballer but a failed manager. In the Championship, managers survive an average of eight months, not even long enough to complete the UEFA Pro Licence course, the top qualification which is required to coach in the top two tiers of English football. Gary Neville is one of a few former England internationals involved in coaching after stopping playing . Jamie Redknapp (left) and Jamie Carragher right) chose to work as pundits upon ending their playing days . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is one of a number of  Dutch professionals who have gone on to coach . It is a staggering statistic but out of the 92 Football League managers, only four have played for England and they have just 25 caps between them. They are Sheffield United’s Nigel Clough (14 caps), Huddersfield’s Chris Powell (5), Aston Villa’s Tim Sherwood (3) and Carlisle’s Keith Curle (3). Here lies the mangled logic at the heart of the problem. In the spirit of the football culture in this country, many good players are impatient, convinced they should bypass the qualification process. They would rather learn on the job but the job is too insecure on which to learn. Time in charge is diminishing, as is the likelihood of a second chance. Little wonder English coaching has become a punchbag for the failing national team, although English coaches actually do nothing much different to their foreign counterparts. Did we not like it when Holland beat England in Rotterdam in October 1993? Look back on the teams and none of Graham Taylor’s players are working full-time in football, although most have tried and some may return. Paul Ince managed for 238 games. Almost all the Dutch side are locked into the game at different levels. Six of them have the Pro Licence, compared with three of the English. Frank de Boer is coach of Ajax and has won the Dutch league four times in as many seasons . Danny Blind (left) is part of Holland's coaching setup and is earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink (centre) Former Arsenal winger Marc Overmars (right) is now the director of football at Ajax . Ronald Koeman is at Southampton and coveted by Barcelona, Frank de Boer is at Ajax, where Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp are in senior roles. Ronald de Boer was involved in the Ajax youth set-up until the club ordered him to choose between his coaching and broadcasting. He chose TV, surprisingly. Move on to the Euro 96 meeting between the nations and the Dutch team includes PSV Eindhoven boss Phillip Cocu and Danny Blind, earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink as Holland coach. With Giovanni van Bronckhorst stepping up to become Feyenoord boss next season, it means Holland’s ‘Big Three’ clubs will be led by legends with more than 300 caps between them. There is nothing comparable in this country. Scour 92 clubs and you can find 25 England caps, property of Tim Sherwood (3), Keith Curle (3), Chris Powell (5) and Nigel Clough (14). There is a better show from some of the other Home Nations. In Terry Venables’ Euro 96 team which beat Holland 4-1, there was Gareth Southgate, now England U21 manager, protected in the confines of the FA bubble where Stuart Pearce spent much of his coaching career and where Gary Neville is learning. There was Teddy Sheringham, part-time at West Ham, and also in the squad were Les Ferdinand, QPR’s director of football, and Steve Stone, coach at Newcastle. Nothing proves elite players make the best coaches. The opposite could be true to some extent when you look at Ferguson, Wenger or Mourinho. But international players can make fine coaches as Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Bobby Robson, Don Howe and Venables proved. Some who have devoted much time to this subject conclude that the trend is rooted in the British culture, where academic teaching has always held sway over sporting education and where youth coaching is not treated as a career in itself — unlike in parts of Europe and the Americas. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell is one of four former England internationals in the Football League . Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood played three times for England but now manages in the Premier League . The opening of St George's Park has boosted the facilities on hand to the England national team . Why would millionaire footballers trade their comfortable lives to start at the bottom of a profession struggling for identity? This friction has lingered since the days of Sir Walter Winterbottom, who met resistance from traditionalists running clubs and the FA when he tried to modernise the England team to keep pace with countries such as Hungary and Italy in the ’50s. Barriers have been removed. The opening of St George’s Park and recent changes to coach education at the FA represent a big step forward according to many, but some views are deeply engrained. Winterbottom once asked Robson, one of his England players, what he might do when he finished playing. ‘I don’t know,’ replied Robson. ‘I don’t think cleaning windows is an option.’ Nor was a job on Sky Sports, so Winterbottom persuaded Robson to attend one of his coaching courses. Imagine Sven Goran Eriksson asking David Beckham the same question. ‘I’m going to help banish child poverty, model underpants and buy a franchise for a soccer team in Florida, Sven.’ How do the Dutch get their players into the coaching system? And how do they stay there when so many of the English slide out? Is it because England is a nation which prefers coaches to have come through the system? Quite the opposite, really. The obsession with rushing big-name players into high-profile jobs was more probably part of the problem. They weren’t ready for it, since they had no coaching experience, and have fallen out of the system, no doubt bruised by those who sit in judgment and brand them coaching failures. Swansea manager Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager, his team eighth in the Premier League . Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, is the highest ranked British coach in fifth . Meanwhile, there are brilliant coaches who have spent their lives in the lower leagues, a welcoming hand never reaching out to them from the Premier League. Many of the ’93 Holland team went through the Ajax gateway to a coaching career, a club with a reputation for producing elite talent. They were not thrown in at Wycombe like Tony Adams or at Stockport like Carlton Palmer. Holland is a hot-house football environment. Fewer professional teams mean it has a more concentrated focus of talent in competition. There is a greater tactical education and a desire to exchange ideas, all of which works for both young players and young coaches. Swansea’s Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager in this country whose team are eighth in the Premier League. Of nine English managers in the top flight, five are in the bottom six fighting to prove their worth as the foreign coaches contest the title with Brendan Rodgers, the top-ranked Brit offering hope in fifth. Mauricio Pochettino has already managed Southampton and Tottenham at the age of 43 . Burnley manager Sean Dyche (left) and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe are both highly rated British coaches . Should anyone slip, there is a ready supply of experienced and fully qualified foreign coaches, often ex-internationals, waiting to step in. Ambitious coaches such as Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino regularly jump ahead of promising homespun talent such as Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe. England, meanwhile, are in danger of surrendering an entire generation of international footballers to an array of media opportunities.</div></td></tr><tr>
