But law enforcement's response to the shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic, violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Madison's top police leaders vowed. "I think it's very clear that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri," said Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The head of the state's largest law enforcement group told CNN Monday that the Madison police department, unlike the Ferguson department, has a strong relationship with the people it serves. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about Robinson's shooting since it happened late Friday night. The chief said he understands people are angry and want answers. "We have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold," he said. Here are some ways Madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in Ferguson: . Difference in what police chiefs did after shooting . Madison: Within hours of the shooting, Koval went to Robinson's mother's home. "We need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an 'I'm sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend," the police chief said. The mother didn't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager's grandparents in the driveway, he said. They told Koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense. "I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences," Koval said. "Nineteen years old is too young." He stressed that "the effort has to be there," in reaching out to the family. "We have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold, as it were." Ferguson: A day after Brown, who was African-American, was killed, protesters took to the streets of the Missouri town. They were incensed that witnesses said Brown's hands were up and that the teen's body had remained in the street, in the sun, for four hours. A month went by before Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson apologized to Brown's family. "I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street," he said, in a videotaped message. A day after Brown's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence. Police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted. One officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog, and St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said some officers wielded shotguns. Four days after Brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in Ferguson, Jackson spoke at a community forum, saying, the situation "has been a tragedy for the city and the country." Responding to criticism that he'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence, he said, "It breaks my heart [that] some think I'm part of the problem." The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. But issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued. "Keep moving" was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks, whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes. In some cases, officers told demonstrators they couldn't stand for more than five seconds; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly. Such a tactic was a violation of the Constitution, a federal judge later ruled. In his videotaped message, Jackson apologized for that, too. "The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry," the police chief said. Five ways the Ferguson police chief is in hot water . Difference in investigation procedures: . Madison: Under Wisconsin law, an outside agency is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings. In the case in Madison, that would be the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes its work, findings will be delivered to the local district attorney, Chief Koval said. On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer-involved deaths. Ferguson: Chief Jackson asked the St. Louis County Police Department to conduct an independent investigation into Brown's killing. It was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County Police Department, told media what led to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. "The genesis of this was a physical confrontation," Belmar said. Brown "physically assaulted" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Differences with timing of releasing the officer's name . Madison: Chief Koval released the name of the officer who shot Robinson within hours of the incident. He is 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny. The chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007. Kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident, the chief said, because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a "suicide by cop" situation. During the incident involving Robinson, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Ferguson: Three days after Brown was killed, Ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer. The reason the department gave? Threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting Brown, Jackson said. The chief said he thought the threats were "credible" and that "the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal." Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures. Difference in how authorities described victim's past . Madison: Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. But when Koval was pressed for more details, he refused to talk about the teen's record or any run-ins with law enforcement. "I could but I choose not to," the chief said. "I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his." Ferguson: Six days after Brown's shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Wilson's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which Brown was allegedly involved before he died. The decision to release that video frustrated many, including others in law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown "are separate issues." "I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go," Johnson told CNN. "Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family." Differences in mayor's reaction immediately after shooting . Madison: Less than a day after the shooting, Mayor Paul Soglin vowed that "there will be answers," the Wisconsin State Journal reported.  "We all deserve to know the facts in this case," he said. "Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them." The promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city's web site. Ferguson: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation. "We don't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories," Knowles said. "Unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served." Speaking a day after a vigil for Brown devolved into a riot, Knowles said on CNN that "the events of last night are not indicative of who we are," and that the chaos was "not constructive" and only "bringing down the community." Difference in size and tone of rallies and tone . Madison: On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators gathered in Madison. "Who do we trust?" some called out, prompting the response, "No one!" And in another refrain, they chanted, "Black lives matter," a phrase that Ferguson protesters coined. Online the #WillyStreet hashtag, referencing to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened, trended. "Praying for Madison tonight," wrote one activist. "Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies." The demonstrations, which have been constant, have remained peaceful. Watch protesters outraged over police killing . Ferguson: Just hours after Brown was killed, a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets. The often-violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks, and protests around the country were held in solidarity. While many protesters were peaceful, in late November buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict Officer Wilson.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)The campaign to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, involves a curious mixture of Iraqi forces -- the army and air force, federal police, powerful Shia militia  as well as Sunni tribal fighters. It's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure. And that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army. A CNN team that's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that Iraqi army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the Shia militia, notably Hadi al Ameri, leader of the Badr Organization. Iranian military advisers are on hand, and highly influential on the battlefield. As ISIS fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands, it might seem odd that the Iraqi army is unable to take them on alone. After all, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of U.S. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment, bases and training. So just why are the ISF incapable of reclaiming territory seized by ISIS? And how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet? The answers go back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003; Iraq's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade. One of the most controversial acts of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein, was to disband the Iraqi army. The decision, taken in May 2003, "immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the U.S. occupiers," as James P. Pfiffner put it in 2010. President George W. Bush told his biographer Robert Draper in 2006: "The policy had been to keep the [Iraqi] army intact; didn't happen." The reasons have been disputed ever since. In some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers; at the same time training of Iraqi police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency. In 2004, as in 2014, the security forces buckled as a Sunni insurgency spread through northern and western Iraq. Billions of dollars were spent creating a new Iraqi army from scratch. But it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions, so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away. Over a seven-year period, more than $4 billion was spent on renovating and building Iraqi bases. Logistical and maintenance support: $2.6 billion. Supply of equipment: $3.4 billion (in addition to what the Iraqis bought themselves.) Training and staffing the Iraqi police: a cool $9.4 billion. With U.S. assistance and the "Sons of Iraq" program to coax Sunni tribes into fighting al Qaeda in Iraq, violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010. But once U.S. forces left at the end of 2011, and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs, things began to unravel. By then, the Iraqi security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty. The only effective units were special forces such as the Golden Division. Sophisticated U.S. equipment, such as M-1 Abrams battle tanks, was not maintained. Corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially. As then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013, the high command of the Iraqi military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-Maliki prized above competence. He bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies. The Institute for the Study of War reported in 2013, "the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-Maliki to choose his preferred officers (nearly all Shia) to head the most significant command positions in Iraq." Al-Maliki also began integrating Shia militia into army units. At the same time, the phenomenon of "ghost soldiers" went unchecked -- men who were either dead or AWOL but whose wages were still being paid, often to corrupt commanders. So the army, in numbers, looked much stronger than it was. In fact, by the time ISIS rolled south, the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000. Nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as ISIS fighters stormed south from Syria in the early summer of 2014. ISIS used speed, discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the Iraqi army didn't have. It had also cultivated allies among members of Sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column, and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee. The desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to Shia shrines in Samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of Shia militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the Badr Organization and the Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-Assad regime in Syria. In June, the most respected religious authority among Iraqi Shi'ites, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed to Iraqis to mobilize against the enemy.  The call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of Shia, determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. The militia -- called al Hashed al Shabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) -- were trained, equipped and most importantly led by Iranian military advisers and quickly became battle hardened. What they lacked in military skills, they made up for in determination. The Iranians have invested heavily in the PMUs. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, seems to have spent more time in Iraq than Iran since last summer and has been photographed around Tikrit. According to several analysts, it is Suleimani that has been organizing and directing the Shia militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations. Christopher Harmer of the Institute for the Study of War says the role of both the Iranians and the Shia militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the ISF. And he says that "if the Tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the Iraqi government's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the Iranians and the PMU are going to demand payback." The role of Suleimani and al Quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in Washington's view -- means that US airpower has not been made available. "The U.S. may not like Iranian influence in Iraq," says Harmer, "but what it absolutely cannot do is provide direct support to an Iranian-led military operation." The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, alluded to the dilemma when in Baghdad on Monday. "What I'm trying to sort out, actually, is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they're receiving from Iran is a reaction to the existential threat [posed by ISIS], or whether it is something longer-term," he said. Soon after taking office, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement. At the time a statement on his website stressed "the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels." U.S.-led efforts to train a new Iraqi army designed to defeat ISIS are well underway. The aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of Kurdish peshmerga. These should be ready for operations by the end of this year; the first brigade has already completed basic training. But as Harmer notes, "the Iraqi Security Forces are yet to go head-to-head with ISIS and win without help from the PMUs. ISIS is demonstrably more capable than the ISF." Clearing ISIS from well-entrenched defenses around Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, seems well beyond the army's capability. In November, Gen. Dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city. That's problematic for several reasons. Kurdish officials told CNN last month that the longer the battle for Mosul is delayed, the tougher it will be. They claim that they cannot maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely. The Iraqi government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there. But above all, the need for Shia militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely Sunni cities is fraught with peril. Human Rights Watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against Sunni communities by the militia. Tikrit is an especially sensitive area: in June last year, ISIS massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority Shia, at Camp Speicher. Some families of the murdered recruits, and a few survivors, have claimed local Sunni tribes may have helped ISIS or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage. HRW Middle East Deputy Director Joe Stork says that "past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter." Tit-for-tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides. ISIS' use of children: Propaganda and military training . During the Tikrit operation, both Prime Minister al Abadi and Hadi al Ameri of the Badr Organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected. Only when the city is taken, will we know whether their appeals were heeded. Harmer says he believes a majority of Iraqis want to see their country survive; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war. But it remains a possibility. One of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the Shiite militia and Sunni tribal brigades into the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than have them operate as independent armies. They are meant to constitute a new National Guard, but the mechanics and timing remain problematic. The leaders of these militia have tasted power; their men have shed blood. They are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when ISIS are beaten. And they won't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)The cost of college has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. Students today face annual costs, between tuition and living, that can easily exceed $10,000 at a community college, $18,000 at a public four-year college (in-state), and $40,000 at a private four-year school. It's unsurprising that today's students often graduate with large debt loads. More than two-thirds of students graduate with debt. And the average amount of debt owed is about $30,000. Given the cost of college, students and families need to know that they're making a good investment. That's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes, not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits. A college degree is the only sure path to middle-class security, and because young people and their parents know that, the cost of college, and the availability of loans and other aid, has become a powerful political issue. But for all the attention paid to the price of college, we haven't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money's worth. Is American higher education worth the price? Are students and their families getting what they're paying for? There's plenty of evidence that for many of them, the answer is no. In 2006, a government study found that nearly 70% of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials. In a 2011 book, "Academically Adrift," researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45% of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking, complex reasoning, and communication skills after two years of college. Even at the end of four years, 36% of the students hadn't gained those skills. Given the evidence, maybe it's not a surprise that employers aren't impressed by recent college graduates. Employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students: the ability to critically think, communicate, work in a team, write effectively, and adapt. Yet only about one-quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today's global economy. A recent Gallup poll found that only 11% of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job. In addition to money, these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests, but the time doesn't seem to have translated into learning. Why is this? Perhaps it's as simple as this: We measure education in terms of time, rather than learning. A four-year degree attests that you have acquired 120 credits. That's an accidental result of the credit hour system, which was created by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie more than 100 years ago, for the purpose of providing struggling professors with pensions. At the turn of the 20th century, Carnegie created a $10 million free pension fund to help professors retire. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which was set up to administer the fund, determined that only "full-time" faculty would qualify for pensions, which they defined as teaching 12 "credit units," with each unit equal to one hour of faculty-student contact time per week, over a 15-week semester. While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload, the credit hour quickly morphed into much more. The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning, but the temptation of an easy-to-understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist. It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier. If credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning, they would be fully transferable across institutions. An hour in Arizona is an hour in New York. But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges, suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves, they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned.  Many students, however, believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next. This is an unfortunate and costly assumption, as community college students in Louisiana will tell you. Until recently, Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four-year state school. That's a year of time and money lost. Given that nearly 60% of students in the United States attend two or more colleges, the nontransfer of credits has huge costs, not only to individuals, but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time. If higher education doesn't trust its own credits, why should anyone else? And Louisiana students aren't alone; transfer students across the country lose credits, which lengthens their time to get a degree. So we have two problems: Students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money-- can't use or transfer them. Others who have accumulated costly credits haven't learned much. And then there's a third dimension: Millions of people who have learned a great deal have no "credit" because they learned it at the wrong place — that is to say, not at a "college." Someone who has spent the last 10 years working as a nurse's aid in a hospital who decides to go get a nursing degree has to start from scratch, taking introductory courses he could probably teach, because colleges treat those without credits as blank slates. Employees at a biotech company with a high-quality on-the-job training program might learn more than someone in a two-year college science program, but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning, the learning won't "count." For the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill, the focus on time rather than learning, especially when between family and work, their time is scarce, is a daunting proposition. State and federal governments add to the problem, because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year, most of it is for time served, in the form of credit hours, rather than learning achieved. We need to stop counting time and start counting learning. What could that look like? We don't have to wonder; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time—some for decades. One relatively new program is Southern New Hampshire University's College for America, or CfA, an online "competency-based" Associate of Arts degree aimed at working adults. The program has no courses, no credit hours and no grades. The school has broken down what students with a degree from CfA should know and be able to do, what it calls competencies. CfA worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for, like communication, critical thinking and teamwork. Then faculty designed real-world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency. Unlike in credit-hour courses, CfA has no seat-time requirements. Students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies. Someone who worked at a PR firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies. And the faster students can progress, the less they will ultimately pay. Students pay $1,250 for all-they-can-learn in six months. This means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they don't already know, rather than wasting it on what they already do. Students at CfA can be confident that their time and money are well spent and, at the end, they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do. CfA is not the only one to offer this to students, nor the only model. Hundreds of schools, from Antioch to the University of Michigan to Purdue University, are looking to offer competency-based certificate, associate, and baccalaureate degree programs.  How are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition? In many cases, the answer is surprisingly simple—and, sadly, not commonplace in higher education—by focusing on what students need in order to, wait for it, learn. Fancy amenities, great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention, but they have little to nothing to do with student learning. Some competency-based programs don't focus on research -- faculty are hired for specific expertise, like curriculum design, English literature or advising. Other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling. This allows for more targeted, personalized support by faculty. There is, however, a downside for students: Self-paced competency-based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time-based credit hour, making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support. Without access to these dollars, the programs will remain one-offs and unavailable to the majority of Americans who could use them. Only recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $150 billion-plus financial aid budget. The U.S. Department of Education is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour, and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the House and Senate to explore innovative ways of paying for learning, rather than time. As higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive, measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students, taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford. Paying for what students learn and can do, rather than how or where they spent their time, would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed, high-quality degrees and credentials.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(Travel + Leisure)Quick, imagine a castle: it probably looks a lot like Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle, the turreted inspiration for Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Each year, more than 1.5 million travelers are inspired to make the steep walk or catch a horse-drawn carriage to reach this castle perched on a rocky outcropping in the Bavarian countryside. "People have always been interested in celebrities and powerful people and their homes," says Cordula Mauss, PR officer for the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces. "Immediately after the death of Ludwig II in 1886, the first tourists came and wanted to see what their king had built as his private residence." While castles, palaces and châteaux naturally pique such curiosity, not all have Neuschwanstein's European fairy-tale looks. Some of the world's most-visited palaces, found across Asia, feature red exteriors, pagodas, gates and carvings. Consider Bangkok's gold-spired Grand Palace, where Thai kings lived for 150 years, and where 8 million annual visitors now traipse through ornate rooms, manicured gardens and temples, including one that houses a revered Buddha carved from a single block of jade. Travel + Leisure: See more of the world's most visited castles . Some longtime royal residences have been repurposed as museums. St. Petersburg's riverfront Winter Palace, for instance, is the sixth-most-visited castle, thanks to the appeal of masterworks by Titian and da Vinci along with lavish restored interiors, where Catherine the Great once held court. America's closest approximation is California's Hearst Castle, though it fell short of Travel + Leisure's top 20 list with only 750,000 annual visitors. And while Windsor Castle squeaked in at No. 19, Buckingham Palace didn't make the grade (567,613 annual visitors), nor did Romania's Bran Castle (542,000) or a single Irish castle. Ireland's most visited, Blarney Castle, received 365,000 in 2013. That said, there can be a downside to having too many visitors -- these are delicate, historic structures that have existed for hundreds of years, and some, like Neuschwanstein, limit daily entries. But it's hard to stem curiosity when it comes to the lives of the blue-blooded. As Mauss puts it: "Who didn't want to be a prince or a princess or at least a knight when he or she was a child?" The Methodology: To tally up the world's most-visited castles, T+L gathered the most recent data supplied by the attractions themselves or from government agencies, industry reports and reputable media outlets. In most cases, it was 2013 data. Here are the top 10: . No. 1 The Forbidden City (Palace Museum), BeijingAnnual Visitors: 15,340,000 . Each day, tens of thousands of visitors pour through the Forbidden City to see the 178-acre walled compound that once shielded the Imperial Palace from public view -- while housing Chinese emperors and their extensive entourages. (To handle the volume, the government has started requiring advance ticket sales during festivals and holidays and prohibiting annual ticket holders from visiting during peak seasons). Bright red buildings topped with golden pagodas exemplify traditional Chinese architecture, while the Palace Museum showcases art, furniture and calligraphy. Source: China National Tourist Office . No. 2 The Louvre, Paris Annual Visitors: 9,334,0000 . The largest and most famous museum in the world -- displaying masterpieces like La Gioconda (the Mona Lisa) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace -- got its start as a palace. The U-shaped Louvre housed generations of French kings and emperors beginning in the 12th century, and the remnants of the original fortress that occupied the site (built for King Philippe II in 1190) can be seen in the basement of the museum. The building was extended and renovated many times. Head to the decorative arts wing for a glimpse of Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie's opulent state apartments, built between 1854 and 1861.

Royal offices are still used within the Grand Palace, and state visits and royal ceremonies like the Royal Birthday Anniversary of the current King Bhumibol Adulyadej are held there each year. This was also the official residence of Thai kings from 1782 to 1925 and counts numerous buildings, halls and pavilions set around open lawns and manicured gardens. The palace's Temple of the Emerald Buddha is considered one of the most sacred sites in Thailand.

When Louis XIV built Versailles in the late 1600s, it became the envy of other European monarchs in Europe, and the opulent estate retains an unmistakable allure. Versailles gets seven times the visitors of any other château in France (apart from the Louvre); it helps that it's easily accessible from Paris. No other palace in the world can match the grandeur of Versailles's Hall of Mirrors, dripping with chandeliers, and Marie Antoinette's bedroom, decorated with hand-stitched flowers. The vast grounds are free most days and an attraction in themselves, with 50 water fountains, a parterre (formal garden), a grand canal and other sites like the Grand Trianon, built for Louis XIV as a refuge from court life, and Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon.

With a lovely setting overlooking the Bosporus and Sea of Marmara, Topkapi Palace was the royal residence for about 400 years until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s. The sultan lived with his wives, concubines, mother and children in the harem, under the fierce protection of eunuchs. Look for the Privy Chamber of Murat III, with its indoor pool, gilded fireplace and walls decorated with blue, white and coral Iznik tiles from the 16th century. The Palace Kitchens reopened in September 2014, displaying fine china and large cookware. And the complex also includes courtyards, gazebos, gardens and the Imperial Treasury.

Catherine the Great and Nicholas I are among the Russian royals who occupied this green-and-white baroque palace along the Neva River from 1762 to 1917. Today, the palace is a museum with one of the finest collections in Europe, including works by Titian, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci (Benois Madonna). Much of the palace was destroyed by fire in 1837, but the beautifully restored interiors speak to the opulent tastes of the Russian elite.

This medieval fortress on the north bank of the River Thames was built to intimidate Londoners and keep out foreign invaders. The oldest part of the structure, the White Tower, dates back to the 12th century. While it originally served as a royal residence, the tower has become notorious for its use as a prison and the site of executions that included Henry VI and Lady Jane Grey. Millions flock to the tower today to see historical reenactments as well as the British Crown Jewels, among them, the Sovereign's Sceptre containing the Great Star of Africa, the largest colorless cut diamond in the world. In 2014, the tower's moat was filled with 888,246 ceramic red poppies in remembrance of British soldiers who died in World War II -- an example of art installations and events held regularly.

The two Australians are making their final journeys from the Bali prison where they have been incarcerated for 10 years to a sinister island they have only heard about called Nusakambangan. There, a firing squad awaits. The grim news that there is now no hope of escaping their fates hangs heavily over the family and friends of the two men. For Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, leaving the Balinese prison which has been their home for the last 10 years brings only fear and dread. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran is escorted on to a flight, en route to Nusakambangan, on Wednesday . A handcuffed Andrew Chan is led up the steps and on to the flight out of Bali to Death Island . Prison home: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been escorted out of Kerobokan prison in Bali, their home for 10 years, and have begun their finals journey, to Nusakambangan, aka Death Island . Growing up inside: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, aged about 22 and 25 years old in 2006 (left), and the men almost a decade later (right) pictured inside Kerobokan jail this week as they awaited the news about their departure from Bali for central Java where they will be executed . Chan and Sukumaran are driven out of of Kerobokan on Wednesday in an armoured vehicle. The streets were lined with police and riot officers . The ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin drug ring were given a Hindu blessing ceremony at Kerobokan prison and said their farewells. Neither man has been outside the walls of Kerobokan since shortly after their arrest on April 17, 2005, when Chan, then a 21-year-old, was seated on a Qantas flight which was ready to depart Ngurah Rai airport. He was not carrying any drugs. Sukumaran only enjoyed a few more hours of freedom, his arrest coming later on the same day at the Melasti Beach Bungalows in Kuta Beach along with Bali Nine mules Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Matthew Norman, who had 11.8 ounces of heroin strapped to their bodies. A set of scales were also in the room. One way trip: The two condemned men will fly to Tunggul Wulung airport in the central Javanese town of Cilacap 700km from  Denpasar airport which they have not seen for the ten years since the Bali Nine were arrested with 8.3kg of heroin in a doomed attempt to smuggle the drugs from Indonesia back to Australia . The 'bandara' or airport (pictured) in the coastal mining town of Cilacap in central java, which is the port for Nusakambangan Island and where two Indonesian military planes carrying Australians Chan and Sukumaran and an escort of armed police will  land today .

Michael Chan, the older brother of death row inmate Andrew Chan is pictured leaving Kerobokan prison in the Balinese capital of Denapasar this week ahead of his brother's transfer to the central Javaneseport of Cilacap for execution on 'death island' All men plus the remaining mules apprehended at the airport with heroin strapped to their bodies were interrogated and taken into custody at the Bali police headquarters before being transferred to Kerobokan. Chan and Sukumaran left the prison never to return, escorted by 22 heavily armed men dressed in black, the members of the Brimob  special police mobile brigade. Handcuffed and walked by figures with their faces hidden by masks and balaclavas, the pair were placed into armoured personnel carriers, called Barracuda or Wolf, and driven on the 30 minute trip to Ngurah Rai airport. Unlikely to have got the chance to see the makeover the airport terminal has undergone since they flew into Bali in 2005, the men were driven across the tarmac to a small prop plane. They are being escorted every step of the way by the Brimob officers. After takeoff Chan and Sukumaran got their last glimpse of Denpasar and Kerobokan prison before the aircraft turned west on its 700km journey. The flight, expected to take two hours, took them over the mountainous terrain of eastern Java, with its volcanoes and verdant highlands, then down to the coast and tiny rundown Tunggul Wulung Airport in Cilacap, which normally opens only between 7am and 2pm and services mostly flight schools. Muslim territory: This is the port of the coastal town of Cilacap in central Java which, in contrast to the Hindu culture of Bali, is Muslim and broadcasts on loudspeakers the five daily calls to prayer . Prison officers share a joke outside a shop at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap as preparations took place for the executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran at nearby Nuskambangan island . From the air strip to Wijaya Pura, the quay to Cilacap's port, it is a 16km drive through a sprawling industrial city, but the Indonesian police are expected to transfer the Australians to Nusakambangan in another armoured vehicle. Although the Australians will miss the bustle of Cilacap's streets, which are choked with trucks and hundreds of noisy motorbikes, their transfer into a different culture will become obvious when they hear their first Islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers.

They will then be taken to Batu or 'stone' prison, one of the island's seven facilities, where prison officers have been preparing special isolation cells to separate Chan and Sukumaran and others due for execution from the remainder of the prison population. Family members will have to take the police boat to Nusakambangan to visit them. The journey takes around 30 minutes and ends at Sodong dock.

'Eksekusi mati' means death by execution in the Bahasa Indonesian language . This eerie hooded figure, featuring in a TV recreation,  is meant to represent the condemned prisoner who has the choice of wearing a blindfold while being executed by firing squad in Indonesia . They will then be allowed visits from their families and  a minister of religion of their choosing as they are given 72 hours to live before they face the firing squad. They will also be asked to make a written final request, which may be in the form of making a statement about their guilt or innocence. They will also be allowed to choose whether they are strapped to the execution post when they face the firing squad and whether they wish to be blindfolded or not. Over on the mainland in Cilacap, Chan and Sukumaran's relatives will be staying in hotels and accompanied throughout the town by Australian embassy staff from Jakarta or Denpasar. Ambulances take the bodies of executed prisoners from 'death island' to the mainland . An ambulance with the body of  executed prisoner, Dutchman Ang Kiem Soei, at Cilacap in January arrives off the police boat from Nusakambangan island in central Java to thedock of Wjaya Pura port . Meanwhile, preparations for the executions are gathering apace, with ambulances due at the Java Christian Church on Friday, where they will be marked in alphabetical order, A to J, for the ten prisoners due for execution and labelled with the condemned person's names. The ambulances will be loaded each with a coffin and taken to the island. At 10pm on Saturday, Cilacap mortician Suhendro Putra will board the police boat with the coffins and be ferried to Nusakambangan. The families of Chan and Sukumaran may also go to the island if they wish, but Mr Putra told Daily Mail Australia that they would probably remain at Sodong dock while the executions took place. Around midnight Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will each be taken to a clearing on the island to face a firing squad of twelve men armed with rifles, nine of which are loaded with blanks and three with live rounds. .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Chelsea midfielder Oscar, Barcelona forward Neymar, and Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo. France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner. CLICK HERE TO READ THE MATCH REPORT IN FULL . Host commentator . And that's it. Brazil come from behind in style to seal a 3-1 win against France and gain a tiny bit of revenge for their World Cup final defeat 17 years ago. Raphael Varane gave the hosts the lead with a powerful header but strikes from Oscar, Neymar and Luis Gustavo secured a deserved victory for Dunga's men. The Real Madrid man gets up and limps back but it looks like he's OK. Brazil's subs still working hard to close down France every time they get the ball. They've seen this out well. Fernandinho replaces goalscorer Gustavo with just added time remaining. Four minutes extra to be played. And off goes Firmino after a bit of discussion. Almost a debut to remember for Fekir as he picks the ball up on the edge of the box, creates some space and gets a low shot away which flashes just wide. Souza replaces Oscar. Schneiderlin bursts down the left and goes down after being clipped by Danilo. The Southampton man wants a free-kick but the referee isn't having it. Goal kick. Douglas Costa comes on for Willian and Giroud replaces Matuidi. Payet replaces Valbuena with just under 10 minutes to play. Neymar skips away from Schneiderlin, drives towards goal but blasts his shot high and wide from a little over 20 yards. To be fair to him the ball appeared to bobble as he struck it. Kondogbia replaces Sissoko and Fekir comes on for Griezmann. And there's number three! Gustavo gets away from his marker and heads the corner beyond Mandanda and into the corner. Awful defending but Brazil probably deserve a two-goal cushion. The visitors move up the pitch at speed with Willian and Neymar both involved. The Barca man picks out Oscar and his curled shot forces Mandanda into a diving save to his left. Corner for Brazil. Some neat skill and a long-range shot from Griezmann forces Jefferson into a fingertip save - possibly his best of the game. Valbuena delivers another good corner but Brazil deal with it. Within a minute of Varane's miss - with a Jefferson save from Sissoko sandwiched in between - Benzema misses a sitter. A deep cross found the Real Madrid man unmarked at the back post but he leant back and volleyed well over the bar. It really hasn't been his night so far. Another dangerous free-kick from France goes all the way through to Varane but he doesn't connect with his shot properly and the ball rolls harmlessly wide. Told you they were starting to play! Willian is involved again and he drives down the middle before laying in Neymar on the left. The Barcelona man takes a couple of touches before lashing the ball high into the net from an acute angle. Brazil starting to play with some style now. They work the ball around France's half before Willian tries to play a killer ball to Neymar. France clear for a corner which Silva almost converts. Sakho loses his footing and Brazil pick up the ball in a dangerous area. It's played into the centre and Gustavo strikes a low shot from about 20 yards which Mandanda does well to save. This time Valbuena picks up possession on the left side of Brazil's box. He makes himself some space and tries to pick out Benzema but his cross is poor and Jefferson claims again. Sissoko bursts through midfield and is brought down by Elias 45 yards from goal. Valbuena curls the free-kick into the area but it goes all the way through to Jefferson. France get the second period underway. How many substitutions we will see in the second half? I'm going for 10. France are struggling to get hold of the ball as the first half draws to a close. Willian combines with Danilo but the right back's pass inside is poor and France clear the danger. Lovely goal. Oscar picks up the ball on the left, plays it inside to Firmino and drives into the box looking for the return. The Hoffenheim man prods it into his path and Oscar produces a low finish with his first touch. Game on. Willian runs on to a pass down Brazil's right, takes a touch and delivers a cross. Brazil are lacking a physical presence up-front and it's obvious here as Mandanda claims under no pressure whatsoever. Firmino picks up the ball in a central area and drives forward. He makes some progress but is eventually crowded out and loses possession on the edge of France's area. Firmino certainly isn't afraid to have a go from distance. This time he picks the ball up about 25 yards from goal and forces Mandanda into a decent save low to his right. Neymar takes the resulting corner but France clear up. ...but this time Brazil just about deal with it. Sakho got up to meet it but his header looped up and into the hands of Jefferson. Brazil now have a free-kick inside France's half after a foul on Neymar... Elias finds some space 25 yards from goal but his shot is high and wide. Should've got his head up and picked a pass, there. France take the lead! Another inswinging corner from Valbuena is met powerfully by Varane and his header flies into the bottom corner. Nobody on either post for Brazil. First real chance of the game for Brazil. Neymar receives a pass just inside the area, uses a defender as a shield and attempts to pass the ball into the bottom corner. Mandanda is equal to it though, palming the ball away. Another mini spell of possession for Brazil but it ends when Oscar inexplicably fires a long pass across the pitch to absolutely nobody. Poor challenge from Filipe Luis, who scythes down the little midfielder from behind. The Chelsea man escapes a booking, probably because it's a friendly. Neymar closes down France's defence and makes an interception but the ball gets away from him and the hosts survive a scare. The visitors are starting to get on the ball a bit more now. Neymar drops deep to pick up possession but he's eventually crowded out and loses the ball in a dangerous area. Moments later Firmino finds some space on the edge of France's box but his low strike is blocked. Valbuena whips in a corner which falls to Benzema just a few yards from goal. The Real Madrid was completely unmarked but he couldn't direct his header past Jefferson, who palmed his effort away and hurt himself in the process. France should have the lead. Lighting run from Willian down the right. The Chelsea man gets past one opponent but a brilliant sliding tackle from Schneiderlin takes the ball away from him. Willian appeared to catch Blaise Matuidi but it's the Brazilian who is left on the turf. No need for treatment and he's back in the game after being helped to his feet. Brazil haven't had possession since Neymar lost his footing - and the ball - inside the first minute. Bacary Sagna and Raphael Varane both involved early on but no chances yet. Brazil get us underway at the Stade de France. France, Brazil and everyone inside the stadium take part in a minute of silence in respect to those who lost their lives in the Germanwings plane crash this week. Perfectly observed. Both sets of players are out on the pitch and lined up for the national anthems. The stadium appears pretty packed considering it's a friendly - looks like Brazil still have plenty of pulling power despite that defeat to Germany last summer. Four minutes until kick-off. Martha Kelner: The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries.

Kieran Gill: The way the unofficial World Cup final works is not unlike a game of conkers, where winner takes all until your next match in an all-or-nothing scenario. Brazil have held the unofficial title since October 11, when they beat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing, China, and have a chance to chase Scotland at the top of the unofficial World Cup ranking table. They have some way to go, however, as Scotland sit top with 86 points, ahead of England on 73. CLICK HERE to read more. Sam Cunningham: Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, by bringing back one of their grittiest former captains. Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland. His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time. CLICK HERE to read more.

Going into the game knowing they needed to win by 26 clear points, Stuart Lancaster's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them finish one of the most remarkable matches in Twickenham history broken, but not bowed. England's players were left distraught as the realisation they had finished so near but so far away from winning the title.

They have reason to be proud. Twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately England finished six points adrift of the total they needed as Ireland claimed the title for the second season running. England could barely have done any more but were punished for a second-half lapse of discipline which saw James Haskell sin binned for tripping and France scored two tries. 'We're absolutely devastated,' said man-of-the-match Ben Youngs, who scored two tries. 'For all our endeavour, we fell short. We're gutted.' Ireland's crushing victory over Scotland at Murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left England with a huge mountain to climb. England began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of Lancaster's tenure. It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday. Parling's Leicester team-mate Dan Cole led his side out on his 50th cap and England knew they would need a titanic set-piece performance, first and foremost, to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win. And from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as England wheeled their opposing eight enough for No8 Billy Vunipola to put extreme pressure on France scrum half Sebastien Tillous-Borde. The France No9 threw a pass to nowhere with Vunipola breathing down his neck and England centre Jonathan Joseph – England's find of the tournament – gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back Mike Brown. Brown worked the ball to George Ford who flipped a clever pass inside to Ben Youngs who pirouetted over the line for a try inside 90 seconds. Ford added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7-0 and England were away. Only a missed penalty attempt dampened the crowd's enthusiasm. Then, disaster struck as Courtney Lawes fumbled a pass from Youngs down the right and Tillous-Borde snaffled the ball with only Cole covering across and the line at his mercy. There was no contest. The France scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the Twickenham crowd. Plisson missed the conversion but moments later France went even further ahead when winger Noa Nakaitaci broke away down the left to score his side's second try inside a couple of minutes. But the left winger can consider himself incredibly fortunate after he brainlessly attempted to run around under the posts only to touch the ball down milliseconds before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line. The Television Match Official agonised over the decision and eventually, after countless replays, the try was awarded. England's Jack Nowell goes over for his second try of the match but England could not find enough points to jump above Ireland . France's Noa Nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from Youngs during the first half . Nakaitaci was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line . England's Jonathan Joseph (centre) is tackled by France duo Maxime Mermoz (left) and Vincent Debaty . England's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another Six Nations title under Lancaster . Plisson's conversion made it 15-7 after 17 minutes and suddenly England's task was even greater than at kick off. Lawes caused a mini fracas when his huge hit on Plisson angered France, although referee Nigel Owens deemed the tackle was fair. Ford then reduced the deficit to five points with a long-range penalty and Plisson missed back-to-back penalties to deny France the chance to pull further ahead. Now it was England's turn to get lucky. Youngs made a searing 40 metre break down the right and fed inside to Ford who was tackled short of the line. James Haskell dipped for the ball but appeared to knock on in the process before gathering and popping to Anthony Watson to cross. But this time the TMO ruled in England's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off Haskell's knee. Ford converted to make it 17-15 after 31 minutes. Game on again. In an astonishing game, Joseph then broke from his own line to make 70 metres before chipping ahead for Luther Burrell. The centre lost out to Bernard Le Roux but earned a penalty which England took quickly and Youngs wriggled over for his side's third try. Ford converted to make it 24-15 and England dared to dream again. A Ford penalty on the stroke of half time left England 27-15 in front after a memorable half but Maime Memoz crossed two minutes into the second half to leave the home side 21 points away from claiming the title. Seven of those came four minutes later when Youngs, enjoying his best game in an England shirt, made a searing break down the right and fed inside for Ford to canter over for his side's fourth try. Ford converted his own try to make it 34-22. Lawes is grabbed by his shirt during the first half as France's players let their frustrations boil over .

England struck again when Jack Nowell crossed after more good work from Youngs and Ford's conversion made it 41-25 after 53 minutes. But England's delight was tempered when Haskell was sent to the sin bin for a blatant trip on Plisson. With Haskell off the pitch, France broke again and Nakaitaci made a searing run down the left. Brown looked to have stopped him but the winger flicked a clever pass to the supporting Vincent Debaty and the prop scored. Kockott missed the conversion leaving the deficit at 11 points. Danny Cipriani was introduced to the fray at full back on 61 minutes with Watson going off and Brown moving to the wing. Within seconds England scored again when Vunipola drove over and Ford converted, leaving England 18 points in front. It was utterly astonishing stuff. France scored their fifth try when replacement Benjamin Kayser drove over from a line out but Kockott missed again to leave the score 48-35. Haskell was replaced by Tom Wood as England began to sense their title hopes were slipping away.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-8-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">England may have thrashed Lithuania to take another step along the road to France 2016 but success has certainly not been confined to the senior team this week. When the Three Lions teams are put together from under 17 level upwards, they have won 11 matches out of 11 during this international spell, scoring 27 goals in the process. The under 21s won 1-0 away to the Czech Republic in a friendly on Friday, while the under 20s have beaten Mexico on penalties after a 1-1 draw and seen off the United States 2-1. England's team from under 17 to senior standard have won all 11 matches played this week . England's under 19s have won the first two of their European Championship qualifiers - 3-2 against Denmark and 1-0 against Azerbaijan, meaning they must defeat France on Tuesday to get through. The under 18s got on a roll against Switzerland, winning 1-0 and 6-1 in a double-header of friendlies, and the under 17s won all three of their European Championship qualifiers - against Norway, Slovenia and Romania. So, on the evidence of the past few days, a bright future awaits for the England team. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the players to have performed well at each age group. UNDER 17 . Ike Ugbo . Age: 16 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Chelsea frontman Ugbo has set his sights on emulating club-mate Dominic Solanke by helping England's under 17s to European glory. Solanke played a key role as John Peacock's side lifted the trophy in Malta last year and Ugbo scored twice against Romania at Burton on Thursday to ensure England made this year's finals in Bulgaria with a 100 per cent record. 'It would be a dream come true for me,' said the Chelsea under 18 player afterwards. 'Seeing them win it last year, with Dom doing as well as he did too, it would be great to be able to follow on from them.' Chelsea frontman Ike Ugbo shoots for goal during England under 17's win over Norway last week . Reece Oxford . Age: 16 Club: West Ham Position: Centre-back . Proudly wearing the captain's armband, Oxford headed home to set the Young Lions on their way to a 3-1 win over Slovenia in the second of their Elite Round qualifiers. Despite being just 16, Oxford has featured regularly in West Ham's under 21 side and is tipped for a very bright future. Indeed, the teenager, who made Sam Allardyce's first-team squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Sheffield United earlier in the season, has been the subject of interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Reece Oxford celebrates scoring for the under 17s against Slovenia in last week's qualifier . Danny Collinge . Age: 16 Club: Stuttgart Position: Centre-back . Scorer in England's 3-1 win over Norway, the first of the three qualifiers, Collinge has been a mainstay of the under 17 team for some time. He is something of a novelty in that he belongs to Stuttgart's academy in Germany, having joined them last summer from MK Dons. Reflecting on his goal against Norway, he said: 'I was over the moon - it was just being in the right place at the right time. But my celebration was a bit poor, that needs some work for next time.' Danny Collinge runs away in celebration after scoring his first England goal against Norway . UNDER 18 . Adam Armstrong . Age: 18 Club: Newcastle United Position: Forward . A pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney proved a source of inspiration for Newcastle hotshot Armstrong, who took his Three Lions goal tally to an impressive 19 in 24 matches with three goals in the friendly double-header with Switzerland over the weekend. Having scored the winner in Thursday's behind-closed-doors match at St George's Park, he contributed two stunners in a 6-1 rout of the same opponents at Walsall on Saturday. Already involved in Newcastle's first team, he has made 14 appearances for his hometown club and was also part of the England squad that won the Under 17 European Championships last season. Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored twice in the under 18's friendly against Switzerland . Tammy Abraham . Age: 17 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Abraham was delighted to get off the mark on the international stage after scoring twice in the 6-1 defeat of Switzerland on Saturday but it was merely the continuation of an excellent season. He is the leading goalscorer nationally at under 18 level with 21 and has also played a key role in the Blues run to the FA Youth Cup final. He will now compete with club-mate Dominic Solanke and Armstrong for an England starting spot. Abraham said: 'I just have to keep scoring. That's the aim of any striker. I'll keep working hard to be picked again, and I'll be doing my best to achieve.' Chelsea's Tammy Abraham scores England's third goal against Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday . Taylor Moore . Age: 17 Club: Lens Position: Centre-back . Another Englishman abroad, defender Moore signed a three-year professional deal with French club Lens late last year. Capable of playing in central midfield as well as defence, the 17-year-old has become a regular in Neil Dewsnip's under 18 side this season. He too was part of the under 17s squad that tasted European glory in Malta last year, converting a penalty during the shoot-out win over Holland in the final. Taylor Moore on the ball during the under 18's emphatic 6-1 win over Switzerland on Saturday . UNDER 19 . Ashley Smith-Brown . Age: 18 Club: Manchester City Position: Defender . It's been quite the week for Manchester-born Smith-Brown, who scored vital winning goals in the under 19's qualifiers against Denmark and Azerbaijan, keeping Sean O'Driscoll's team on course for the finals in Greece. Primarily a right-back, Smith-Brown is more than capable of playing in any defensive position and has been involved with City's under 21 side this season, as well as the UEFA Youth League squad that reached the quarter-finals. Ashley Smith-Brown of Manchester City pictured in the colours of England . Patrick Roberts . Age: 18 Club: Fulham Position: Winger . A key component of the under 17 team that lifted the European Championships last year, Fulham whizzkid Roberts has quickly advanced to the under 19 level and looks very much at home. Indeed, in the initial qualifying phase he scored four goals and set up four more. Roberts made his Premier League debut last season and has continued to play for Fulham following their relegation to the Championship. Roberts has scored four goals for England during the current qualification campaign . Izzy Brown . Age: 18 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward/winger . Another member of the England team that triumphed at the Under 17 European Championships, the prolific Brown has made the step-up to the under 19 standard effortlessly and scored in the 3-2 win over Denmark last week. He is already a member of Jose Mourinho's first-team squad but features mainly in the Blues under 21 squad and the under 19 team that has reached the last four of the UEFA Youth League. Izzy Brown celebrates scoring for England against Italy in an under 19 international at Rotherham . UNDER 20 . John Swift . Age: 19 Club: Chelsea Position: Central midfield . An accomplished central midfield player, Swift has worked his way up the England youth ladder from the under 16s and is now a central cog in Aidy Boothroyd's under 20s. He opened the scoring in Sunday's 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth. Brought through the Chelsea academy, Swift is currently out on loan at League One club Swindon Town to gain experience and has impressed, scoring two goals in 10 matches as they push for promotion. John Swift in action for the England under 20s in their 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth . Moses Odubajo . Age: 21 Club: Brentford Position: Right-back . Brentford's Odubajo was called into the under 20 squad by coach Aidy Boothroyd for the first time and impressed in both matches to suggest that future appearances in the Three Lions shirt may be on the cards. The 21-year-old has been important in Brentford's surprising push for Premier League promotion this season and made the transition to the international arena effortlessly, putting himself in the frame for a place in Gareth Southgate's under 21 squad for the summer's European Championships. Moses Odubajo delivers a cross during England's under 20 win over the United States on Sunday . Alex Mowatt . Age: 20 Club: Leeds United Position: Midfield . This was Mowatt's second appearance in the colours of England and he made a strong case for future inclusion with a good performance in the win over the United States. His form in that match compliments his good season for Leeds United in the Championship, where he has made 31 appearances in all competitions and become a mainstay of the side. Leeds United star Alex Mowatt on the ball for the under 20s in their win over the United States . UNDER 21 . Tom Carroll . Age: 22 Club: Swansea City on loan from Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder . Scored the winning goal as England under 21s defeated the Czech Republic, host nation of this summer's European Championships, on Friday night. The midfielder has been a part of Gareth Southgate's squad for some time and has been playing for Swansea City during this campaign on loan from Spurs. Tom Carroll celebrates with a clenched fist after scoring England's winner against the Czech Republic . John Stones . Age: 20 Club: Everton Position: Defender . A player who has experience with the senior team but seems content to gain experience with the under 21s for the time being. He figured in the win over the Czech Republic and looks set to be included in the squad for the Euros in the summer. Still only 20, Stones is a regular fixture in the Everton defence and manager Roberto Martinez has tipped him for a bright future for both club and country. Stones pictured in training ahead of England's under 21 game with the Czech Republic . Matt Targett . Age: 19 Club: Southampton Position: Left-back . Another product of Southampton's prolific production line, Targett made the jump up to under 21 standard on Friday night having previously played for the under 19s and under 20s. It has also been a breakthrough season for the 19-year-old at club level, with Ronald Koeman playing him in 12 Saints matches this term.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It was a foregone conclusion that  HTC would use this year's Mobile World Congress to launch its latest handset, but the Taiwanese firm had something else up its sleeve. At the event in Barcelona the phone maker unveiled early details about a full-body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system, dubbed RE Vive, moves beyond just a headset and uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games. At Mobile World Congress HTC unveiled early details of a full-body virtual reality system developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system moves beyond a headset (pictured) and uses Kinect-style lasers to track the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in game . Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example. HTC’s Vive has ‘full room scale’ and two wireless controllers with hand tracking. A developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year. The system is powered by the Oculus Rift technology and HTC will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch. HTC also used the event to unveil its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band, in partnership with Under Armour. In particular, the M8's rear-facing 4 Ultrapixel camera has been added to the front of the M9, and the M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles.The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example (pictured) Ultrapixels are, for all intents and purposes, another name for megapixels. However, each individual pixel is marginally larger meaning they capture more light. In addition to the upgraded lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed around the human eye. When a photo is taken on the One M9, this algorithm makes it appear as close to how the human eye would view it as possible, with the same light adjustment and focus. It also adds similar depth qualities, boosted by the dual camera the firm originally added on the M8. 'I have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around, but HTC’s Vive system has convinced me otherwise. During the demonstration I was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset, two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles. For the demonstration version, the headset was attached to the computer using wires. But the HTC spokesman told MailOnline this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless. During a demonstration MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset (pictured), two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles . Once I put the headset on, a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in Star Trek. The demonstrator handed me the wireless controllers, which in itself was a strange experience to see controllers ‘floating’ towards you but not see the hands holding them. I was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right. The first ‘experience’ dropped me underwater onto a sunken ship. Small fish swam around me, which I could ‘touch’ and move. I could look over the edge of the ship and explore the deck. If at any point I approached a real-world obstacle, a feint grid would appear to warn me. During this experience a virtual stingray swam near my face and a huge whale made me jump as it appeared on my left shoulder and cast a shadow over me. Another experience involved painting in the air. Colours and brushes were selected with the left controller and painted with the right. These paintings hung in the air and I was able to walk through them. I also made snow fall around me. A third involved exploring a kitchen, making a meal and serving it. At one point I dropped an egg near my foot and it broke and made a mess. I could use the controllers and triggers to pick up objects, move them around and drop them. These skills were then put to the test during another experience in which I had to repair a robot. While the final experience had me placed in the middle of a virtual battle. I could explore the battleground and kneel down so my face was in line with the ground. I couldn't count the number of times I jumped, laughed, expressed surprise and was wowed by this technology. And this is an early version, with a limited number of trials. By these standards, this technology has the potential to live up to HTC’s claims of being revolutionary. That said, there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that’s convenience. I can’t imagine many people have rooms they can dedicate entirely to this technology, or want to spend money on a host of kit, rather than just a headset. As it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year’s Mobile World Congress.' Victoria Woollaston . The 'full-body virtual reality system' was a surprise announcement at an event where HTC also unveiled it M9 handset and a fitness band. The M9 has added incremental changes compared to previous M8 (pictured) and these include taking the 4 Ultrapixel camera from rear of M8 and adding it to the front of the M9 . Handset: HTC has also unveiled its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band . Beside this, however, the changes between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. These include highly customisable themes and dynamic home screens. Using the phone's location, and by learning about a user's habits, the M9 will change which icons appear on the home screen throughout the day. For example, if it knows the user is at home it will prioritise gaming and social network apps, but when it senses the user is near a tube or train station it will push the National Rail app - or similar - to the front. It only suggests apps that the user has already installed, and the suggestions can be customised or switched off completely. Elsewhere, the M9 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon technology and features 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of storage with the option to extend this using an SD card, plus all customers get 100GB Google Drive for two years. MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of HTC's new device. 'There is little to get excited about with the One M9. 'Its predecessors- the original One known as M7 and the One M8 - are well-made, well-built and were global successes. 'And the M9 is more of the same. 'This means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade, especially from the M8. 'The standout feature of the M9 is its cameras. 'HTC leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of 'smartphone photography'. 'By adding the 4Ultrapixel camera from the M8 to the front of the M9, it also understands its customers love of selfies. 'Seeing the Dynamic Exposure in action does highlight how shots on iPhone and Android devices can sometimes fall short, but again, this isn't a reason to upgrade on its own. 'Beyond that the innovations are minimal. 'HTC prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks, but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you're a Samsung or Apple owner. 'Many of its software features, such as BlinkFeed and the new dynamic homescreen, will appeal to hardcore HTC fans, but may seem like bloatware to others. 'That's not to say the phone is poor, and if an M7 owner is looking to upgrade then the M9 seems like an obvious choice. 'But by tapping into its existing market rather than looking to expand, the handset may struggle to emulate its predecessors successes.' The phone will be available from 31 March in three colours - 'gold on silver', 'gum metal grey on grey' and 'gold on gold.' Prices are yet to be announced. HTC also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with Under Armour. The partnership was announced in January and Under Armour’s team of designers, sports scientists and athletes have worked with HTC’s Connected Products to create the wearable. It will work with UA Record - an app that lets people record and analyse their activity levels from various other apps such as MyFitnessPal and Endomodo. The band  pairs with Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+ to also show phone notifications. It will additionally respond to gestures to make it easier to control when exercising, for example. HTC said the band launch in the US later this year and the company is 'evaluating' it in Europe. Again, no price details were given. The M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. In addition to the new lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed to mimic the human eye. When a photo is taken this algorithm adjusts exposure, focus and depth accordingly. This is boosted by the dual-lens setup added on the M8 (shown) Beside the camera updates, the differences between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental, with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. Many of the leaked specifications (pictured) before the event have been confirmed including 3GB of RAM, screen size, operating system and processor .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-10-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs. A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa, tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks. Providing a unique glimpse in to life under ISIS' brutal and oppressive control, each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football, and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs. Militants: A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa (pictured), tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks . Dictats: Each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS . Each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets last month are numbered and dated, and are written in Arabic. It is understood the 32 fatwas are taken from approximately 70 new rules and regulations issued by the Islamic State in 2015. The letters are written in Arabic and address the city's population, which terror analysis website Jihadica claims proves they are meant for local use, not wider propaganda purposes. The fatwas are unlikely to have been issued by any body other than ISIS' official Sharia Council, to whom even leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reports. Jihadica claims that this means 30-year-old Bahraini scholar and council leader Turki al-Bin'ali is the likely author. Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets show that the list of new rules have been issued in a kind of stapled book and are structured in a question and answer format. Although they pieces of paper are dated using an official Islamic State calender, Jihadica converted the dates to show that they were issued to citizens between December and February this year. Oppressed: Among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under ISIS to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs . Horror: At times the fatwas make harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron . The fatwas issued by the Islamic State are highly bureaucratic, demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group's officials, insisting fighters cannot leave territory under ISIS control under any circumstances, and banning women from showing their eyes. At times they make for harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons. The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as when citizens are due compensation,  how women should ensure they are dressed, and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor. Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is  banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat. On a lighter note, both billiards and table football are allowed  - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that God does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits. Gambling on matches is, predictably, banned, but so is using table football characters shaped like humans, as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under ISIS' exceptionally strict interpretation of Islamic law. Fatwa 35: December 11, 2014 . One fifth of all war booty it is to be given to the office of war booty. Fatwa 36: December 11, 2014 . Tax should be levied on agricultural holdings that once belonged to apostates. Fatwa 37: December 16, 2014 . It is not permissible to travel to the lands of the unbelievers - including areas controlled by the Assad regime. Fatwa 38: December 2, 2014 . It permissible to curse  by accusing someone of being a disbeliever, but you must never say they are destined for hellfire. Fatwa 40: December 17, 2014 . Women should not wear make-up or show any part of their face, including their eyes, in case lures men into temptation. Fatwa 41: December 17, 2014 . Women can carry weapons such as Kalashnikov rifles under their robes providing they do not add definition to her body, luring men into temptation. Fatwa 42: December 17, 2014 . Female nurses must not work in an office with a male doctor unless they have a male guardian. Fatwa 43: December 17, 2014 . Women must see only female doctors for treatment. If a female doctor cannot be found, then it is permissible to see a male doctor, but on the condition that he not be alone with her. Fatwa 44: December 17, 2014 . Women must cover their entire body in thick, loose fitting material that does not resemble the clothing of men or that of women in the West. They must not slap their thighs or act flirtatiously as it is highly arousing, nor can they wear perfume. Fatwa 45: December 17, 2014 . A woman must travel with a male guardian at all times . Fatwa 46: December 17, 2014 . Women whose husbands have been killed must be punished if they try to leave ISIS-held territory for the lands of the unbelievers. Fatwa 47: December 18, 2014 . The length of time between the call to prayer and the call just before prayer must vary from prayer to prayer, according to the sunnah. Fatwa 48:  December 20, 2014 . You must not sell Islamic State passports to allow citizens to travel to the land of unbelievers. Fatwa 49:  December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play billiards providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, or inhibit the worshiping or God . Fatwah 50: December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play foosball [table football] providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, feature characters in human or animal form, or inhibit the worshiping or God. Brutal: The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as how women should dress and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor . Fatwa: Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' One chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that ISIS operates an organ harvesting scheme. 'It is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a Muslim, in order to save the latter's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs,' the letter states . 'The jurists of the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Islamic law, among others, permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life-saving measure. The case of organ transplantation as a life-saving measure is similar,' it adds. 'Moreover, it is established that the lives and organs of apostates are fundamentally licit. Their organs may thus be taken, whether or not the apostates are alive or already dead, and whether or not doing so results in their death,' it goes on to claim. AK-47 assault rifles, one fatwa insists, are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women's clothes, providing it doesn't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men. Likewise all forms of Western clothing are banned in order not to 'imitate the unbeliever', although the fatwas still feel the need to say it is illegal to sell counterfeit brand-name clothing and household products, as selling fake produce is a form of deceit. One surprising law bans the practice of men swapping sisters or daughters for brides of their own, apparently because it 'does an injustice to the bride'. Instead, ISIS demand, the bride must grant permission for any marriage to take place. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme.

Crowds of mourners and activists were seen waving flags and holding placards of the murdered Russian politician's face as they made their way through the city centre towards where he was killed on Friday night. As the vast protest snaked its way through the Russian capital, men, women and children could be seen holding back tears as they held up signs reading: 'I am not afraid.' Meanwhile in London, dozens of protesters waving Ukrainian flags gathered outside the Russian Embassy to demonstrate against Vladimir Putin's government. Scroll down for video .

There were an estimated 20,000 on the streets, while organisers claimed there were as many as 70,000. Demonstrations on this scale are rarely seen in Russia, where the government does not often give approval to mass protests. Hundreds had already planned to rally against Vladimir Putin's today, but this protest was abandoned to instead demonstrate against Mr Nemtsov's death in an apparent 'contract hit' in the shadow of the Kremlin. Russian riot police, armed with batons, were observing the protest which remained peaceful. The mood was sombre, with heavy security as police helicopters flew overhead and police boats patrolled the river. Families, the old and young walked slowly, with many carrying portraits of Mr Nemtsov, who was shot dead while walking home from a restaurant in central Moscow on Friday night. 'If we can stop the campaign of hate that's being directed at the opposition, then we have a chance to change Russia. If not then we face the prospect of mass civil conflict,' Gennady Gudkov, an opposition leader, said before the march. 'The authorities are corrupt and don't allow any threats to them to emerge. Boris was uncomfortable for them.' The march follows last night's demonstration on the bridge where Mr Nemtsov was shot, with scores of mourners gathering to lay flowers. Among placards left among the tributes were some reading 'je suis Boris', 'Putin killed my friend' and 'we are all Nemtsov'.

Critics linked his killing to the deaths of journalists at the French political magazine, Charlie Hebdo, who were slaughtered by Islamic extremists after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. CCTV footage showed the Russian opposition leader walking along the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, before a person is seen approaching him from the shadows. The gunman then makes a quick escape in a car nearby. In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader. 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with Russia's Sobesednik news website. He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views. '"When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that." She was completely serious,' he added. Opposition activists also blamed the Russian President for his death, claiming they were in 'no doubt' it was politically motivated. Murdered spy Alexander Litvinenko's widow has said Boris Nemtsov's shooting was the Russian government's way of saying that anyone who spoke out against Vladimir Putin would be killed.

Mr Nemtsov was shot four times on a Moscow bridge after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya to dinner . The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River . Marina Litvinenko described news of the veteran liberal politician's shooting as 'absolutely devastating'. She was asked on BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme whether she believed the shooting of Mr Nemtsov near the Kremlin in Moscow was linked to her husband's poisoning. She replied: 'It's a different way to kill a person, but a way to present that anybody who will try to say something against us will be killed.' Ilya Yashin, a friend and fellow opposition leader, said he hoped the killing would not frighten people. 'Essentially it is an act of terror. It is a political murder aimed at frightening the population, or the part of the population that supported Nemtsov and did not agree with the government. I hope we won't get scared, that we will continue what Boris was doing. 'It was President Putin who created this atmosphere of hate in our country, the atmosphere of intolerance, which one way or another materialized in the bullet that killed my friend Boris Nemtsov.' Meanwhile the Kremlin, which uncharacteristically allowed the protest to go ahead, is investigating whether the killing is linked to the conflict in Ukraine. National investigators who answer to the Russian leader say they are pursuing several lines of inquiry, including the possibility that Mr Nemtsov, a Jew, was killed by radical Islamists or that the opposition killed him to blacken Putin's name. Putin's opponents say such suggestions show the cynicism of Russia's leaders as they whip up nationalism, hatred and anti-Western hysteria to rally support for his policies on Ukraine and deflect blame for an economic crisis. 'It is a blow to Russia. If political views are punished this way, then this country simply has no future,' Sergei Mitrokhin, an opposition leader, said of Mr Nemtsov's murder. Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55. His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician. He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms. The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses. Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret. He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">New York (CNN)The house is primitive, constructed of baked mud and stone. The landscape is sparse and mountainous, with snow cover in the winter. The terrain is rugged and challenging for the long walks the owner liked to take with his sons. Photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in Manhattan federal court offer a rare look inside Osama bin Laden's lair -- years before al Qaeda flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed U.S. embassies in Africa and even before the FBI placed bin Laden on its Most Wanted List. Still, bin Laden was preparing, hiding out in a remote, mountainous area of Afghanistan known as Tora Bora. A remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin Laden in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin Laden lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for al Qaeda in London in the mid-1990s. Al-Fawwaz would arrange bin Laden's first television interview for CNN's Peter Arnett and Peter Bergen in 1997 and a sit-down for ABC News' John Miller a year later. But before then, al-Fawwaz called on a Palestinian print journalist, whose 1996 journey to Afghanistan yielded these photos. Bin Laden had declared war on the United States and wanted more people to know it, especially in the Arab world. He reached out to Abdel Barri Atwan, the founder and then-editor-in-chief of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, an independent Arabic weekly published in London that had been critical of certain Arab regimes and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Atwan had broken the story about bin Laden's first fatwa, or religious decree, stating his grievances against the United States, such as the presence of U.S troops in Saudi Arabia. He published the entire screed in August 1996. The next month, al-Fawwaz went to Atwan's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in Afghanistan. "I was told that Osama bin Laden was fond of my writing, he liked my style, and he wanted to meet me personally," Atwan recalled in an interview for Bergen's 2006 book, "The Osama bin Laden I Know." "I was hesitant, because it was very dangerous." Danger aside, in November 1996, Atwan was airborne to Afghanistan. The date-stamped photographs from his trip -- which Scotland Yard detectives discovered two years later in a search of al-Fawwaz's London home -- show a healthy, relaxed, sometimes smiling bin Laden, not yet 40, conversing, hiking, videotaping pronouncements, surrounded by children. The photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, better known as Abu Musab al-Suri, a Syrian now in his mid-50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade. Still, al-Suri is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in Islamist militant circles today. "A generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings," said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has written about al-Suri. "He wanted a global jihadist intifada, where people rose up and fought  as individuals. "His teachings have deeply influenced jihadis in Syria -- how to build up an organization, how to win support for it," he said. Bin Laden, from Saudi Arabia, first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to Soviet invaders, one of thousands of Arab fighters defending a Muslim nation. As the anti-Soviet jihad wound down, bin Laden began organizing al Qaeda, meaning "the base," around the border city of Peshawar, Pakistan. By 1992, Pakistan forced him and his fighters to leave. Bin Laden relocated to Khartoum, Sudan, welcomed by a new Islamist regime. But after four years headquartered there, in 1996, under pressure from the United States, Sudan made bin Laden go. By then, the ideologically in sync Taliban had taken control of Afghanistan, and bin Laden decided to move there. In May 1996, bin Laden settled in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. His mountain fortress in Tora Bora was a long drive up a dirt road he had built. Atwan was driven there in a red Toyota pickup in a twisting seven-hour drive through the mountains. As a photo of him shows, Atwan donned Afghan-style baggy trousers and a turban to get past security checkpoints and fit in. Atwan met bin Laden in his cave. It was small, 13 by 20 feet in Atwan's estimation, and as the new photos show, it was lined with shelves of books about the Koran and the Prophet Mohammed. Bin Laden liked to use the bookshelves as a backdrop for his videotaped edicts and interviews. The cave not only offered bin Laden a hiding place but also street credibility in the Muslim world, as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the Koran while camped in his own mountain cave. After hours of conversation and an inedible dinner featuring salty cheese and sandy bread, Atwan ended up bunking in the cave on a mattress that rested on boxes of grenades. "He wanted media exposure," Atwan recalled in the interview for Bergen's 2006 book. "He wants to say, 'Now I am an international figure; I'm not just a Saudi. I am aggrieved at  Americans who are occupying Saudi Arabia who are desecrating the Holy Land.' " As seen in the photographs, bin Laden always carried a Russian-made Kalashnikov rifle. His comrades addressed him as "Abu Abdullah," for father of Abdullah, his eldest son. Two younger sons, Saad and Ali, then in their early teens, sometimes were at the compound. As one photo shows, Atwan and bin Laden took a two-hour walk around Tora Bora. "He loved that nature there. He loved the mountain. They were trying to have their own community, grow their foods," Atwan recalled. "It's like an oasis in Afghanistan." Bin Laden's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share bin Laden's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the Tora Bora mountains, where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns, and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood-burning metal stove. Hunger was a frequent companion to the bin Laden children who lived on a subsistence diet of rice, bread, eggs and that salty cheese. In December 2001, with U.S. troops retaliating for 9/11 closing in, bin Laden fled Tora Bora, eventually making his way to Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs ended a decade-long manhunt by killing him in his Abbottabad hideout, an hour north of Islamabad. Atwan stepped down from the helm of Al-Quds in 2013 and recapped his journey in a deposition for the al-Fawwaz trial. Al-Fawwaz was convicted in Manhattan federal court on February 26 and faces a possible life sentence. Even in Tora Bora, Atwan felt bin Laden was vulnerable to intelligence agencies. "I thought this man would not last," Atwan said Tuesday. "He wasn't really well-protected. He was visible and moving freely." In 1996, bin Laden knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings, the planes plot that would become 9/11. Atwan said, "He was very optimistic, and it never occurred to me that this would be the most be dangerous man in the world." With his pale skin, short red hair and beard, and green wool hat, Abu Musab al-Suri could pass for Irish.  But he is Syrian, originally from the ancient city of Aleppo, fought in the anti-Soviet Afghan war, and lived in London in the 1990s. Al-Suri was close to bin Laden, which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of Tora Bora, seated next to al Qaeda's leader in his cave or hiking with him, carrying his own cameras. (Al-Suri also accompanied Bergen and Arnett on their visit to bin Laden in 1997.) The United States has since accused al-Suri of training recruits at al Qaeda's pre-9/11 al-Ghuraba and Derunta camps in Afghanistan, where operatives such as Ahmed Ressam, who planned to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999, learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals. Eventually, al-Suri publicly criticized bin Laden for making al Qaeda so hierarchical, for courting publicity and being so controlling, even calling him a "Pharoah" for his imperial leadership style. But al-Suri was no less militant. He set up his own training camp in Afghanistan and advocated a "leaderless jihad" featuring, as he put it, "spontaneous operations performed by individuals and cells all over the whole world without connection between them." Al-Suri summarized his philosophy in his 1,600-page treatise, "The Call for Global Islamic Resistance," which he published on the Internet in 2004. He coined the Arabic slogan nizam, la tanzim, meaning "a system, not an organization," to describe his belief that there should be no organizational bonds between "resistance fighters." Al-Suri advocated terrorist cells of no more than 10 men and envisioned more "lone-wolf" attacks, such as the Fort Hood, Texas, massacre carried out in 2009 by rogue U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who was inspired by the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, himself an al-Suri disciple. Strategically, al-Suri argued, a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies, because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement. Al-Suri was forward thinking about al Qaeda evolving into an international ideology more than a centrally controlled organization. After 9/11, al-Suri appeared on the U.S. Most Wanted Terrorists list with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. In 2005, al-Suri was tracked down in Quetta, Pakistan, and sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned. There were unconfirmed reports that he was released in 2012, followed by al Qaeda statements by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and spokesman Adam Gadahn in 2014 saying, "May Allah release him." A decade after his arrest, al-Suri's whereabouts are a mystery. A gripping glimpse into bin Laden's decline and fall .

An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory.

The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of ‘chokers’ and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand’s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps’ fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla’s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side’s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw’s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier’s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier’s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34.

It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel’s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The first thing you need to know about Jose Mourinho is just how much he loves winning football matches. It is everything to him — whether it is the Barclays Premier League, the Champions League or a charity match. Last summer, Jose was in charge of the Rest of the World for Soccer Aid, I was playing for Sam Allardyce’s England side and Mourinho’s team were leading at Old Trafford going into the final moments. To ensure the advantage was preserved, however, Mourinho — with a glint in his eye — had a word with James McAvoy, the Hollywood actor, who he was putting on as substitute. Not long after, James had gone to ground with an ‘injury’ to help run the clock down. The job was done and they won 4-2!

Cesc Fabregas controls the ball as the Premier League leaders look forward to Sunday's Southampton game . I must stress that it was all good-natured, but on Wednesday night against Paris Saint-Germain, the actions of a Mourinho team were significantly darker. I called Chelsea’s behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a Champions League quarter-final place. They went beyond what is acceptable but, unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen them do it. I doubt it will be the last, either. Mourinho and his teams take winning to a level that other teams and managers do not. Mourinho shakes hands with fans before the start of last summer's Soccer Aid match at Old Trafford . Jamie Carragher (centre) played for Sam Allardyce's England side for the charity game in June last year . As the seconds dwindled, James McEvoy (left) went down with an injury as the the Rest of the World won 4-2 . Respect for Mourinho’s achievements in the game is beyond doubt. In a few years from now, we could be acknowledging him as the most successful manager of all time, particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches, as is his current remarkable ratio. But will he be loved? Chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him. Porto and Inter supporters will too. Yet beyond that? It is debatable. Will he care how he is remembered? I think he will. Deep down, I think everyone in football cares how they are perceived. Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch referee gives Zlatan Ibrahimovic his marching orders . It was this tackle by the Swede on Oscar that had the Chelsea players swarming round the ref . Ibrahimovic's night was over after the tackle in the first half . Every outfield Chelsea player except Oscar was involved in the mass protest . Are trophies more important than creating good memories? I would always argue ‘yes’ to that. During my career, I won 10 major honours but none of the Liverpool teams I played for is particularly remembered for being a top side. If I’m honest, it annoys me, especially when I hear stories even now of how great Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle team of 1995-96 were or how thrilling the Leeds team were that reached the Champions League semi-final in 2000. Yes, they both played fast, exciting football but what did they win? Nothing. Mourinho led Porto to the UEFA Cup in 2003 and the Champions League a year after . Mourinho grabs Marco Materazzi after guiding Inter Milan to their third European Cup in 2010 . You want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime, like the Real Madrid team of the 1950s that Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas inspired to five consecutive European Cups or the Ajax team of Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff from the 1970s. They took that style on to the Dutch national squad. Cruyff once said, ‘how you play is more important than what you win’ and to some extent, he is right. The Holland side from the 1974 World Cup, for instance, get spoken about more than the West German squad that actually won it. Personally, I would have rather been a German than in the Dutch squad that came up short. The same goes for Brazil in 1982, the other great team that captured hearts but failed to conquer the world. Real Madrid's Raymond Kopa, Rial,  Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Gento pose before a game in 1959 . Johan Cruyff rounds Argentina keeper Daniel Carnevali before scoring in the 1974 World Cup quarter-final . The great Brazilian side of 1982 celebrate Socrates' wonderful equaliser in the 3-2 defeat by winners Italy . I know most of the names of that great squad, as I am sure many do — Zico, Eder, Falcao, Socrates — but what would those men rather have, a winner’s medal — like their compatriots in 1970 — or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played? In an ideal world, you get remembered for winning with style. The best example I have of that from my childhood was the AC Milan team of Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten that was guided by Arrigo Sacchi in the late 1980s. Their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the European Cup. Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, however, are the team that took style and success to another level all together. They will still be writing books about them in 50 years, such was the swagger with which they won 14 trophies in four extraordinary years. When a team wins silverware with imagination and fantasy, it almost seems more special. Mourinho is just as prolific at collecting trophies as Guardiola but the brand of football his team play does not compare. That is why, in the long-term, you won’t find his teams spoken about like some of the others I have mentioned. The behaviour of the teams, of course, doesn’t help either. Chelsea have been likened to the Leeds team from the 1970s but I actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during Mourinho’s first spell in England. They were prepared to push it further still. Pep Guardiola is thrown by his adoring Barcelona players after winning the 2011 Champions League . Leeds players surround Ray Tinkler after the referee controversially allowed Jeff Astle's goal in 1971 . John Terry, John Mikel Obi, Ashley Cole and Michael Essien get in referee Rob Styles' face in 2007 . None of that might bother Mourinho, in the same way it didn’t bother Rafa Benitez. I remember him once telling me about a conversation he had with a Spanish journalist, about what was perceived as ‘great football’ and ‘winning football’. Rafa was puzzled by this, so he asked the journalist: ‘Who scored Spain’s winning goal in the 1964 European Championship?’ The reply came: ‘Marcelino’. So Rafa then asked, ‘And how did Spain play in the game?’ to which there was silence. Oscar appeared to be no worse off after Ibrahimovic's midweek tackle as he trained on Friday . Diego Costa sat down for a bit of keepy-uppy at Cobham as the players prepared for Southampton . Mourinho keeps a close eye on things as the Blues boss gets his side ready for Sunday's lunchtime kick-off . His point was all that mattered was Spain had won the trophy. Mourinho would clearly understand the logic in that argument. I can see what he means, too. But the idea of winning at all costs? That is something with which I am not comfortable. I loved winning, there was nothing better that you could experience in football. But when all is said and done, you want to be remembered and respected for what you achieved. And if Mourinho’s teams keep taking things to the brink, the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come. Hughes revival will put big clubs on alert . There is a big game in the Midlands with West Bromwich Albion coming up against Stoke. Praise for the work of Albion’s Tony Pulis, the former Stoke boss, shows no sign of dwindling, particularly after he was named manager of the month for February. West Brom are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the Barclays Premier League next season. But what about Mark Hughes, the man who succeeded Pulis at Stoke? Tony Pulis won the manager of the month award for February after his fine work at West Brom . Mark Hughes (right) has flown under the radar but has led the Potters to eighth in the Premier League . Without grabbing any headlines, Hughes has impressively manoeuvred Stoke into eighth place in the Premier League and they have built on their efforts of last season. They spent just £1.2million last summer, and lost Bojan Krkic to a serious knee injury, but they continue to get good results. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more points since Boxing Day. The work Hughes has done at the Britannia Stadium seems to have gone under the radar. His journey since he was sacked in a poor manner by Manchester City in December 2009 hasn’t always been smooth. For instance, he was criticised for the way he left Fulham in 2011 and was then sacked by Queens Park Rangers after spending less than a year at Loftus Road, even though he kept them in the top flight in May 2012. But he has rebuilt his reputation in the Potteries and looks like he will be rewarded with a new contract. If he continues to make such impressive strides, he may get the chance once again to work at a club that can regularly compete for top honours. This week I'm looking forward to... Seeing if Everton can keep flying the flag in Europe . Another disappointing week in Europe for teams from the Barclays Premier League but, once again, Everton proved an exception to the rule. The last hour of their clash with Dynamo Kiev saw Everton playing at their best under Roberto Martinez — the football was good, the energy was high and there was an intensity in everything they did. It all helped to show how difficult Romelu Lukaku  can be to play against in that mood. He bulldozed his way past a number of challenges to set up Steven Naismith’s goal, showed character to take the crucial penalty and bullied Dynamo’s defenders, including the highly-rated Aleksandar Dragovic. He now has 16 goals for the season. Romelu Lukaku skips past Aleksandar Dragovic (left) during an all-action display against Dynamo Kiev . Lukaku's penalty was not convincing, but it hands Everton the upper hand in the tie ahead of the return leg . When you see Everton play like that, you wonder why they have struggled in the Premier League. But if they replicate the performance that gave them a 2-1 lead to take to Kiev, they will have an outstanding chance of beating Newcastle for just their second league win of 2015. As soon as Everton start getting points on the board again, the tense atmosphere around Goodison Park will relax and Evertonians will be able to enjoy the European adventure a little bit more.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-15-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The first video of Mohammed Emwazi - identified last week as ISIS executioner Jihadi John - has emerged . The first footage of ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged. The video shows Mohammed Emwazi, identified last week as the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football. The previously-unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi was educated. The friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of Emwazi before he became the ISIS's depraved executioner-in-chief. In the film, obtained by Channel 4 News, the 'football mad' teenager, thought to be around 15 at the time, is  the second person to be chosen for the team. One of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting 'Emwazi', beckoning over the future jihadi. But he also appears to be painfully shy, instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him. Channel 4 News said Emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time. The footage, filmed in May 2004, was broadcast this evening, after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother. According to a former friend of his brother Omar, Emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008, while he was living on the notorious Mozart estate in west London. After viewing the footage, Diane Foley, the mother of American journalist James Foley, told Jon Snow it was 'frightening' that a 'promising young person who had many gifts' could use his talents for 'such evil'. She said: 'It's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate. That's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate?' She added that the fact Jihadi John had been identified did not help to bring her closure. She said: 'If it had not been that young man, then I'm afraid it would have been someone else. I think it's tragic for that young man and his family - it's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality.' Since being identified, Emwazi has emerged as a fun-loving young boy, who adored The Simpsons, Playstation games and eating chips. He was also said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30. Scroll down for video . The video shows Emwazi, aged around 15, being chosen by a captain to join the team for a game of football . The footage, which is the first time any moving image has been obtained of Emwazi, was shot in the playground of Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in Queen's Park . In a handwritten entry in his primary school yearbook, the Kuwaiti-born British citizen, who moved to the UK aged six, wrote: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer'. The entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world's most wanted man, who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of Islam. But, a decade later, Emwazi had shunned British life and was a 'known wolf' to MI5, having already taken the path towards becoming ISIS' most notorious murderer. In a chilling twist, in a school yearbook from when he was 10, Emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game 'Duke Nukem: Time To Kill' and his favourite book as 'How To Kill A Monster' from the popular children's Goosebumps series. He also lists his favourite band as pop group S Club 7, and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30, writes: 'I will be in a football team and scoring a goal.' Emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue, his favourite animal as a monkey, his favourite cartoon as The Simpsons and chips as his favourite food. Earlier this week, it emerged Emwazi was bullied as a schoolboy at the school in which the film was made. Emwazi, pictured as a schoolboy, was said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30 . The terrorist has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab . Former headteacher Jo Shuter told Radio 4's Today programme: 'He had adolescent issues. Particularly at that age, for the boys, it is a time when the hormones start raging, and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with. 'By the time he got into the sixth-form he was, to all intents and purposes, a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted to go to.' After arriving in Britain when he was six years old, the  extremist appeared to embrace British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. He had moved to Britain in 1993, settling in the north-west London suburbs of Maida Vale and Queens Park. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. The footage was filmed at Quintin Kynaston Academy School in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi attended secondary school and was said to have been bullied . He was also described as 'calm and decent' and 'the best employee we ever had' by  an IT firm for whom he worked in Kuwait. But, at some point during his lifetime, Emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of MI5. It emerged today that the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK. The 26-year-old a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command. He had been watched by the services since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab. Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain. En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab. Emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He alleged an agent from MI5 knew 'everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with' and claimed the organisation attempted to 'turn' him to work for them. By Arthur Martin for The Daily Mail . The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi . Jihadi John’s family are being guarded by armed police at a secret location in a security operation costing taxpayers more than £5,000 a day. Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command provide round-the-clock protection for the Islamic State killer’s mother, brother and three of his sisters. The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi. They initially left their £600,000 London flat, where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby. But when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21, was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names. They have been receiving an estimated £40,000 a year in benefits since they sought asylum in Britain in 1993. The family fled Kuwait after the first Gulf War, claiming persecution as they were seen to favour the Iraqi invasion in 1990. But after they were made British citizens Emwazi’s father Jasem, 51, returned to Kuwait – the country he claimed he fled fearing for his life. His daughter Asma, 25, is also there. Meanwhile Emwazi’s mother Ghaneya, brother and three of his sisters continue to drain the public purse of thousands more in protection costs. None are suspected of wrongdoing but police are thought to be questioning them about their contact with Emwazi since he moved to Syria. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public will be angry that the family are receiving such expensive protection, but added that the police are in an ‘impossible position’. They initially left their £600,000 London flat (pictured) where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby . Scotland Yard refused to comment on the family’s whereabouts or security arrangements. Friends of the family said Emwazi’s father moved close relatives into a safe house in Kuwait after his son’s identity was revealed. Last night a former friend of the terrorist said he once kidnapped two boys at gunpoint in retaliation for a gang attack on his brother. Emwazi forced the teenagers into a car and ordered them to strip to their underwear before dumping them on the M1 motorway. The kidnapping was said to be retribution for a vicious attack the previous day when Emwazi and his younger brother Omar were attacked with bricks. Then, when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21 (pictured) was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names . It occurred in 2008 when Emwazi was studying at the University of Westminster – a year before he was quizzed by the security services on suspicion of trying to reach militant training camps in Somalia. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said the attack was sparked by gang rivalries involving two West London estates. ‘There was a big fight,’ he said. ‘[Gang members] threw a brick at my head and broke my arm. Omar was punched in the face a few times and beaten up. ‘The next day Mohammed turned up with two religious guys with beards. They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. They dumped them on the M1.’</div></td></tr><tr>

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-17-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The president of the University of Oklahoma has condemned the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for the racist chant that emerged this weekend and vowed to discipline the students involved - but stopped short of saying they would be expelled from the university. David Boren expressed outrage today at the racist song by members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and revealed that school officials have already identified at least two of the students seen singing 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' on a party bus over the weekend. 'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.' Scroll down for video . Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . University of Oklahoma President David Boren used a bullhorn to address students Monday morning at a rally against the SAE fraternity . Fraternity members moved furniture out of the house in the rain on Monday afternoon. They've been told the vacate the premises by midnight . This student's parents helped him move his belongings out of the SAE house into the back of their Cadillac Escalade SUV . A mother puts a comforting arm around her son in the wake of his fraternity being kicked off campus and shamed the world over for a racist chant . Hundreds of furious students have rallied on campus in Norman this morning to protest the outrageous song by the fraternity brothers. Boren's comments come as a new video emerges that shows a frat brother trying to stop the recording of the sickening song aboard the Sigma Alpha Epsilon party bus. As one tuxedo-clad brother gleefully sings, 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** in SAE' - another stands up and waves his hands in front of a cell phone camera, attempting to stop the filming of the shameful song. Earlier on Monday, Boren gave the fraternity members less than 24 hours to vacate their house on campus. He may have offered to buy the frat members a bus ticket out of town - but it seems some of the members will drive a Cadillac instead. An Escalade SUV was among several vehicles - including two U-Haul trucks that were parked outside the fraternity on Monday morning, according to KOCO-TV. Fraternity members refused to talk to members of the press as they packed up their belongings and loaded them into the trucks. According to the campus student newspaper, the Oklahoma Daily,  several fraternity members were also seen fleeing the house on Sunday night with packed suitcases. At a rally on Monday morning, shamed the fraternity brothers, according the Oklahoman newspaper: 'You are disgraceful! Real Sooners are not bigots, real Sooners are not racist.' Fury: Hundreds of students rallied on the campus in Norman, Oklahoma, on Monday morning to protest the horrific chant by the fraternity members . Using the slogan 'Unheard' black students - and their allies - used the occasion to protest what they say is a history of racism at the university . Students refused to speak with reporters as they packed up and left the fraternity. They loaded their belongings into U-Haul trucks and SUVs . Packing up: U-Haul trucks and several SUVs appeared at the SAE fraternity to move members and their belongings out of the house ahead of the midnight deadline to vacate the premises . The OU mascot is the Sooner - in honor of the homesteaders who took up plots of land across the state in the late 19th century. In a statement, he said that the members of SAE have until midnight Tuesday morning to clear everything out of the fraternity house. 'Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE are hereby severed. I direct that the house be closed and that members will remove their personal belongings from the house by midnight tomorrow,' he said. A vandal approached the house an spray painted 'Tear It D' across the wall of the frat house - presumably meaning to paint 'tear it down.' At the SAE chapter at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, a Confederate flag could be seen hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers. It was visible from the street through the fraternity's window, according to the O'Colly student newspaper. It has since been taken down. Coming down: University workers on Monday tore down the Greek letters for SAE on the fraternity house - after officials cut all ties to the fraternity . Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above. The university has cut off all ties to the fraternity and will ban it from campus . Fraternity members refused to speak to members of the media on Monday . Parents came out in to help their college children move out of the fraternity house on Monday . Alumni of the fraternity have also begun raising money Howard, the African-American cook who ran the kitchen at the fraternity for more than 10 years. Blake Burkhart wrote on the IndieGoGo campaign: 'That man is going to walk up to the SAE house tomorrow morning and hear that he no longer has a job. He is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade. He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids.' The campaign has raised more than $11,000 toward its goal of $50,000 to help provide support for Howard after losing his job. Also on Monday, rapper Waka Flocka Flame canceled his show at scheduled for this spring at the fraternity house. In a statement, the Atlanta-based musician said: 'I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate.' The racist footage that kicked it all off was uploaded to YouTube Sunday and shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity. In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march. 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE. 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.' A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard. In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished. Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished . Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic. He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'. Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions. A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. 'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently. At Oklahoma State University, the SAE chapter has a Confederate flag clearly visible from the street, hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers . A vandal painted 'TREAR IT D' - presumably 'tear it down' - on the wall of the fraternity on Sunday night . 'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. 'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.' SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.' For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following: . 'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">There was nothing more mind-numbingly maddening in the aftermath of England’s worst World Cup exit yet than the immediate reaction of Peter Moores. ‘We thought 275 was chaseable. We’ll have to look at the data,’ said a coach now fighting to avoid his second ignominious exit from international cricket as the reality of an embarrassing group stage elimination sank in. Well, England should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one-day cricket and start again. Peter Moores faces an uncertain future following England's humiliating exit from the 2015 Cricket World Cup . England were beaten by 15 runs at the Adelaide Oval to make it four defeats against Test-playing nations . England captain Eoin Morgan looks dejected as he leaves the field after their World Cup match . Morgan's fifth ODI duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the World Cup . 90 - the amount of runs captain Eoin Morgan scored in five innings at the World Cup . 12.2 - the overs it took for New Zealand to beat England's total of 123 in their second group game. 111 - Australia's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament . 654 - total of runs scored by Australia and Sri Lanka against England . 1 - number of centuries scored by an England batsman against Test playing nations . 72 - number of runs scored by Sri Lanka off the bowling of Chris Woakes . 0 - number of wins registered by England over Test playing nations in the tournament . 0 - the number of centuries scored by a Bangladesh batsman in a World Cup before playing England on Monday. 37.4-1-234-5 - Chris Woakes's tournament bowling figures. 49 - the amount of runs Steven Finn went for in two overs against New Zealand. You do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and, after this 15-run defeat by Bangladesh, are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world. The only statistic Moores needs to know is that England, having been thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, were humbled by a Bangladesh side who beat them here at their own very English game. The key data is that England, having defeated just Scotland so far, have excelled themselves in being even worse at this World Cup than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in Australia. And this humiliation has come after the Ashes were moved and a winter of one-day cricket provided to try to make sure England had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50-over trophy that looks further away than ever. In truth, arranging a one-day series against Sri Lanka before Christmas was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because England are light years away from the dynamic, vibrant teams we have seen here. To hurl all the blame in the direction of Moores would be unfair but there is no question that his position must now come under serious scrutiny, as too will that of the man who re-appointed him in Paul Downton. Colin Graves does not become ECB chairman until May but he is not the sort of man to postpone a big decision and the coach and managing director may soon be caught up in the new broom that is sweeping through the English game. England batsman James Taylor reacts after he was dismissed during the 15-run defeat by Bangladesh . Moores faces an uncertain future following England's humiliating exit against Bangladesh . Dec 19 - Alastair Cook replaced by Eoin Morgan as England ODI captain . Jan 14 - England beat Prime Minister's XI by 60 runs as Ian Bell hits magnificent 187 .

Jan 23 - Australia beat England by three wickets via a Steve Smith century . Jan 30 - England beat India by three wickets to set up tri-series final with Australia . Feb 1 - Same old, same old as Australia again beat England by 112 runs to win tri-series . Feb 9 - England beat West Indies by nine wickets in World Cup warm-up match .

Feb 28 - Sri Lanka beat shameful England by nine wickets for a third crushing defeat . 'There was no obvious team to pick because they're young players, they haven't played a lot of cricket. We've got nine guys who haven't been to a World Cup before. 'That's the reality of it. You make your choice, you pick the side you think is the best team, which we did, and we have to accept they didn't play well enough.' Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen were among those criticising England on Twitter after their early elimination in the group stages. 'England had the wrong team, the wrong style of play and everyone could see it. Tonight's result is not a shock, I feel for Morgan. Coach is in trouble,' Warne tweeted. Pietersen added: 'I cannot believe this. I just cannot. But, well done Bangladesh! You deserved it! 'Do not say we haven't prioritised ODI cricket! We played a back-to-back Ashes to make sure England played six months of ODIs before this World Cup!' Gary Lineker, the former England striker, said: 'Bangladesh win! Congratulations to them. The good news is, England can't possibly get any worse.' And Piers Morgan wrote: 'What an absolute disgrace. [Paul] Downton and Moores have dragged English cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty, clueless incompetence. 'I want  Downton and Moores sacked today and Kevin Pietersen restored to the team. This farce just reached its true, hideous nadir. 'I wouldn't trust Downton and Moores to run a ****ing bath, let alone the England cricket team.' Moores pictured after the defeat as he speaks with press in Adelaide about their World Cup exit . To highlight Moores immediate mention of data on television is not to take a cheap shot at a decent man who appears to be liked and respected by players who on the whole have let him and their country down here. By the time he gave a more considered press conference yesterday there was no mention of the statistics that seem to have weighed down even a free spirit in Eoin Morgan, who has been a huge disappointment as captain here. My gut feeling is that Moores will be given the summer before England think about replacing him but a personal view is that maybe his assistant Paul Farbrace, an Asia Cup and World Twenty20 winner with Sri Lanka before throwing in his lot with England, could take extra responsibility for limited-overs cricket. England are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests in 10 months and the danger is that one-day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of England’s list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken. The overwhelming favourite to succeed Moores if and when he goes is Jason Gillespie but he distanced himself from the role yesterday and there is no doubt that the Yorkshire coach and his family are happy and settled in Leeds. Joe Root (centre) exchanges words with Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza (left) at the Adelaide Oval . Bangladesh sealed a surprise win over England at the World Cup as Moores and his men suffered elimination . Gillespie has already turned down a role with his native Australia under Darren Lehmann and has been given permission by Yorkshire to coach a team, probably Adelaide, in next year’s Big Bash while staying at Headingley. The constant year-round slog of international cricket is making it harder for countries to attract the best coaches and former Yorkshire chairman Graves may need to be at his most persuasive if he wants to recruit his old county coach. Moores and Downton are not the only ones under the microscope. Morgan refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one-day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss England’s one-day international against Ireland in May, their first of another ‘new’ era, to play in the IPL. Well, I am sorry but if he does want to continue then he needs to be with the team in his native Dublin, particularly as it will be impossible for England players touring West Indies next month to make the Ireland trip on May 8. The sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for England to catch up in 50-over cricket is to build a new young team of one-day players as different as possible to that which will contest Test cricket in the next year against West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa. Eoin Morgan looks to have been given the backing by Moores to continue as England's one-day captain . Alastair Cook (left) was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup . Ian Bell, who left England far too much to do against Bangladesh by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls, will surely bow out of one-day cricket after Friday’s dead rubber against Afghanistan while it is in the best interests of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for them to do the same. Joe Root was strongly considered for the one-day captaincy by England when they sacked Alastair Cook before they plumped for the out-of-form Morgan and I would give him the one-day job now and build a new team around him. It is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by Root and including Jos Buttler, who came so close to recuing England yesterday, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jason Roy, James Vince, Sam Billings and Adil Rashid growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one-day world. But the seam bowling remains a huge worry, not least the absence of a quick left-armer. Bangladesh, worthy quarter-finalists now, had the fastest bowler on show yesterday in Rubel Hossain, who took four wickets, and that must be the first time they have ever had more pace at their disposal than England. The lack of variety in England’s bowling is one of the many reasons why they will be on their way home before the business end of this elongated tournament. And why they will be returning to the drawing board when they get there in their never-ending search for one-day success.</div></td></tr><tr>

Not with David James, Phil Neville, Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon sharing their expertise and defensive acumen. Or maybe there’s the midfield craft of Steve McManaman, Paul Scholes, Owen Hargreaves and Jamie Redknapp. Or the striking instincts of Alan Shearer and Michael Owen. That’s a decent international team right there, boasting more than 500 caps and more than a hundred goals, even without Match of the Day host Gary Lineker. Or Gary Neville, one of a few England internationals from his generation involved in coaching, when his Sky TV duties allow.

Wright: BBC broadcaster . Ian Wright  is dejected after England's hopes of reaching the World Cup in 1994 . Many former England stars have opted for the sofa. Who can blame them? Coaching is a vocation, an all-consuming passion; not something to dabble at in the hope of discovering you possess a magical gift. Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson have devoted their lives to it. Many top players from the previous generation were chewed up and spat out having been through the usual routine: use your name to get a job, discover it’s damn hard and totally different to being a player and either get disillusioned or sacked or both. Soon the name doesn’t open doors because you’re no longer a star footballer but a failed manager. In the Championship, managers survive an average of eight months, not even long enough to complete the UEFA Pro Licence course, the top qualification which is required to coach in the top two tiers of English football. Gary Neville is one of a few former England internationals involved in coaching after stopping playing . Jamie Redknapp (left) and Jamie Carragher right) chose to work as pundits upon ending their playing days . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is one of a number of  Dutch professionals who have gone on to coach . It is a staggering statistic but out of the 92 Football League managers, only four have played for England and they have just 25 caps between them. They are Sheffield United’s Nigel Clough (14 caps), Huddersfield’s Chris Powell (5), Aston Villa’s Tim Sherwood (3) and Carlisle’s Keith Curle (3). Here lies the mangled logic at the heart of the problem. In the spirit of the football culture in this country, many good players are impatient, convinced they should bypass the qualification process. They would rather learn on the job but the job is too insecure on which to learn. Time in charge is diminishing, as is the likelihood of a second chance. Little wonder English coaching has become a punchbag for the failing national team, although English coaches actually do nothing much different to their foreign counterparts. Did we not like it when Holland beat England in Rotterdam in October 1993? Look back on the teams and none of Graham Taylor’s players are working full-time in football, although most have tried and some may return. Paul Ince managed for 238 games. Almost all the Dutch side are locked into the game at different levels. Six of them have the Pro Licence, compared with three of the English. Frank de Boer is coach of Ajax and has won the Dutch league four times in as many seasons . Danny Blind (left) is part of Holland's coaching setup and is earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink (centre) Former Arsenal winger Marc Overmars (right) is now the director of football at Ajax . Ronald Koeman is at Southampton and coveted by Barcelona, Frank de Boer is at Ajax, where Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp are in senior roles. Ronald de Boer was involved in the Ajax youth set-up until the club ordered him to choose between his coaching and broadcasting. He chose TV, surprisingly. Move on to the Euro 96 meeting between the nations and the Dutch team includes PSV Eindhoven boss Phillip Cocu and Danny Blind, earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink as Holland coach. With Giovanni van Bronckhorst stepping up to become Feyenoord boss next season, it means Holland’s ‘Big Three’ clubs will be led by legends with more than 300 caps between them. There is nothing comparable in this country. Scour 92 clubs and you can find 25 England caps, property of Tim Sherwood (3), Keith Curle (3), Chris Powell (5) and Nigel Clough (14). There is a better show from some of the other Home Nations. In Terry Venables’ Euro 96 team which beat Holland 4-1, there was Gareth Southgate, now England U21 manager, protected in the confines of the FA bubble where Stuart Pearce spent much of his coaching career and where Gary Neville is learning. There was Teddy Sheringham, part-time at West Ham, and also in the squad were Les Ferdinand, QPR’s director of football, and Steve Stone, coach at Newcastle. Nothing proves elite players make the best coaches. The opposite could be true to some extent when you look at Ferguson, Wenger or Mourinho. But international players can make fine coaches as Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Bobby Robson, Don Howe and Venables proved. Some who have devoted much time to this subject conclude that the trend is rooted in the British culture, where academic teaching has always held sway over sporting education and where youth coaching is not treated as a career in itself — unlike in parts of Europe and the Americas. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell is one of four former England internationals in the Football League . Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood played three times for England but now manages in the Premier League . The opening of St George's Park has boosted the facilities on hand to the England national team . Why would millionaire footballers trade their comfortable lives to start at the bottom of a profession struggling for identity? This friction has lingered since the days of Sir Walter Winterbottom, who met resistance from traditionalists running clubs and the FA when he tried to modernise the England team to keep pace with countries such as Hungary and Italy in the ’50s. Barriers have been removed. The opening of St George’s Park and recent changes to coach education at the FA represent a big step forward according to many, but some views are deeply engrained. Winterbottom once asked Robson, one of his England players, what he might do when he finished playing. ‘I don’t know,’ replied Robson. ‘I don’t think cleaning windows is an option.’ Nor was a job on Sky Sports, so Winterbottom persuaded Robson to attend one of his coaching courses. Imagine Sven Goran Eriksson asking David Beckham the same question. ‘I’m going to help banish child poverty, model underpants and buy a franchise for a soccer team in Florida, Sven.’ How do the Dutch get their players into the coaching system? And how do they stay there when so many of the English slide out? Is it because England is a nation which prefers coaches to have come through the system? Quite the opposite, really. The obsession with rushing big-name players into high-profile jobs was more probably part of the problem. They weren’t ready for it, since they had no coaching experience, and have fallen out of the system, no doubt bruised by those who sit in judgment and brand them coaching failures. Swansea manager Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager, his team eighth in the Premier League . Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, is the highest ranked British coach in fifth . Meanwhile, there are brilliant coaches who have spent their lives in the lower leagues, a welcoming hand never reaching out to them from the Premier League. Many of the ’93 Holland team went through the Ajax gateway to a coaching career, a club with a reputation for producing elite talent. They were not thrown in at Wycombe like Tony Adams or at Stockport like Carlton Palmer. Holland is a hot-house football environment. Fewer professional teams mean it has a more concentrated focus of talent in competition. There is a greater tactical education and a desire to exchange ideas, all of which works for both young players and young coaches. Swansea’s Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager in this country whose team are eighth in the Premier League. Of nine English managers in the top flight, five are in the bottom six fighting to prove their worth as the foreign coaches contest the title with Brendan Rodgers, the top-ranked Brit offering hope in fifth. Mauricio Pochettino has already managed Southampton and Tottenham at the age of 43 . Burnley manager Sean Dyche (left) and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe are both highly rated British coaches . Should anyone slip, there is a ready supply of experienced and fully qualified foreign coaches, often ex-internationals, waiting to step in. Ambitious coaches such as Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino regularly jump ahead of promising homespun talent such as Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe. England, meanwhile, are in danger of surrendering an entire generation of international footballers to an array of media opportunities.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-20-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">What was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an Australian man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke. John and Christine Rose were on a holiday in Slovenia in June last year, visiting their daughter Bernadette Smon, her husband, and their grandson, when the sprightly 70-year-old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke and was rushed to hospital in the capital Ljubljana. The couple had taken out the highest level of travel insurance with Allianz Global Assistance, and despite being assured on the day of her husband's stroke that the funding needed to bring him home would be quickly provided, Mrs Rose was left helplessly begging the insurer for five weeks before any action was taken. The holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an Australian man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke . John (right) and Christine Rose were on a holiday in Slovenia in June last year, visiting their daughter Bernadette Smon and their grandson (left), when the sprightly 70-year-old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke . 'The whole experience was terribly traumatic. Seeing your father have a stroke and nearly die is awful enough, and then to have the company not provide coverage just made everything worse,' Mr Rose's daughter, Bernadette Smon told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Rose had no pre-existing medical conditions, and was extremely fit for his age, riding 35 kilometres to his work on the Gold Coast each day. The stroke left the Mr Rose with severe memory loss- to the extent that he could not remember which country he was in- and without the ability to walk. Mrs Rose was initially assigned a case worker, but over the course of five weeks allegedly spoke with at least 18 different staff members with Allianz, who she claims had not read the case notes before they rang her. 'It was so upsetting to hear her be asked the same questions over and over, and to have supposedly medically trained staff ask to speak to my father who was very clearly not in a position to communicate,' Ms Smon said. 'Every day that they delayed my father declined. He lost 18 kilograms while he was in hospital, and every time my mum asked why Allianz was unable to fly my dad home they came up with an excuse,' she said. The Rose's claim that the delay in funding by Allianz prevented Mr Rose from receiving the rehab he needed . The 70-year-old (before the stroke) was rushed to hospital where he waited five weeks to be sent home . 'In emails they blamed 'world events' and 'time zone differences', which made no sense because we were checking them all the time. My father was stuck in a foreign country where neither he nor my mum spoke the language which is completely unfair,' she said. A statement from Allianz said that it was important to highlight that 'what may be interpreted as ‘taking time’ to make decisions and get someone home is actually a highly rigorous process that has the safety and well-being of the patient at the forefront of every decision.' 'Ensuring we take the time to understand the exact situation and impacting factors is paramount to ensuring a safe and secure transit home,' the statement said. Mrs Rose was informed that Allianz was waiting on a report from her husband's neurologist to confirm that he had not had a pre-existing medical condition and that their claim was valid, despite providing medical history to the company when they took out the insurance. A customer service representative allegedly told Mrs Rose that the company was trying to prove that her husband did have a condition, in order to avoid paying the claim. 'They were legitimate customers, they knew what their age was and did the smart thing and took out proper travel insurance,' said Ms Smon. 'In the end he just became a number to them, a projective cost that they didn't want to pay,' she said. Mr Rose spent five weeks in the Ljubljana Hospital in Slovenia (above), and lost 18 kilograms . Mr Rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the Slovenian hospital, as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to Australia . 'When we are informed that one our customers requires medical treatment we ensure that we are obtaining medical information from the treating medical team overseas. Coinciding with this we also request a medical report from our insured’s GP in Australia,' the statement from Allianz said. 'This allows us to have a view of any current or previous medical history our insured may have, understand whether there are any existing medical conditions we need to be mindful of when looking at repatriation options and to assess whether the claim falls within the insured’s travel cover,' 'In some instances, as was the case with the Rose family, the information provided by the GP may lead to further questions or require further clarification from other involved medical professionals. In this case we ensure we speak to all appropriate medical specialists to understand exactly what the medical history of the insured is.' Ms Smon said that the way her father was treated was very clinical and claimed that the company has lost touch with the fact that it deals primarily with people in need. 'Obviously what they forgot is that he is a father, a grandfather, and a husband, and that every minute of every day he was declining,' she said. Mr Rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the Slovenian hospital, as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to Australia. Ms Smon said that despite doctors at the Slovenian hospital recommending that Mr Rose be flown back to Australia lying down with trained medical nurses to accompany him, Allianz asked for a family member to fly with him. Mr Rose's daughter said that Allianz did not provide an ambulance to transport Mr Rose to the airport . Mr Rose with his grandson before the stroke, which left him unable to walk and significant memory problems . She said that the Chief Medical Officer of Allianz directly denied the recommendations of the hospital, which her family believes was due to the high cost of contacting the nurses. 'My father had to be put on antidepressants, and by the time he left his dosage had doubled. I cannot emphasize enough the emotional impact this had on my whole family,' Ms Smon said. 'In the end after hearing my mum talk to the 18th person I decided to get on Facebook and complain publicly and ask them what the hell they were doing,' she said. 'Within two hours I had been contacted by Allianz and the funding to send my father back to Australia was all approved. It took a public threat to make them take action, which just goes to show what kind of company they are.' Mr Rose's daughter said that Allianz did not provide an ambulance to transport Mr Rose to the airport, and had never been contacted by the company's local agent, who was meant to be organising all the paperwork on the ground. 'It was my mother and I who were standing at hospital photocopy and fax machines trying to get everything sorted. We were just left on our own,' Ms Smon said. 'Where a stretcher repatriation with 2 medical escorts is deemed the safest form of travel (as was the case with the Rose family), we must speak to airline providers to understand the availability for the transfer home – peak travel periods can make this difficult as stretcher repatriations require up to 10 economy class seats for the patient and the medical escorts,' the statement from Allianz said. Mr Rose (above left, with his wife) had no pre-existing medical conditions, and was extremely fit for his age, riding 35 kilometres to his work on the Gold Coast each day . Ms Smon said that her mother (left) has never received any follow up on the incident, despite sending multiple emails, and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience . 'Airlines can take up to 7 days to clear a patient for travel as it requires their medical team being happy with the information as well as clearance from the engineering team. If the airline requires further medical information from the treating hospital, this can add to the time it takes to get clearance.' Ms Smon said her father's rehabilitation has been significantly delayed due to the amount of time it took to bring him back to Australia, and that he is still not able to walk up stairs and has no feeling in his left hand. 'His mental health deteriorated in the period he was there, he thought he was in Poland and kept saying how long it had been since I'd seen him when I'd visited only a few hours ago,' Ms Smon said. 'We are talking about a smart, fit, Australian man who taught IT at university, whose hard-earned money went to insurance coverage,' she said. 'We weren't trying to wrought them; we just wanted to bring him home. Now he needs a full-time carer and we are dealing with the effects of the stroke on a day to day basis.' Ms Smon said that her mother has never received any follow up on the incident, despite sending multiple emails, and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience. 'It affects us every single day- emotionally, physically, and mentally. For us to even hear the name Allianz brings up terrible images of my dad withering away in the hospital,' Ms Smon said, . 'It was terrible and unnecessary and there was a complete lack of reality behind it all,' she said. 'You can vote with your dollar, and until people in ivory towers start to treat customers like people and not like numbers this won't get better.'
