The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering "a psychotic episode" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence "revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012," the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as "four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine." The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets "to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave," the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an "exemplary" character who "never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself," The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, which a neighbor described as "kind of like Mayberry," the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in "a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community." There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's "inland empire" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. "Academically, he was at the top of the top," Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so "when his life was over," court documents said. Holmes was "denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor," according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing "a lot of people" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a "behavioral evaluation and threat assessment" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. "Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team" in "the first 10 days" of June, but it "never came together" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of "dysphoric mania," a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. "It was," Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him "because I am bad news," the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: "Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved," they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, "justice is death," said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. "He is not a monster," Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is "morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill." "He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness," the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-2-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">(CNN)On the stage of a TV studio in Phnom Penh, Cambodian-American Ly Sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic, but familiar, story. On April 17, 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as Ly knew it was shattered when her hometown, the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. Ly, then 13, was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who, along with virtually the entire population of Phnom Penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work. Ly never saw them again, nor learned what happened to them. But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates. The urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence. Aimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years. Ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979. His killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States. For more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister. "I think she was the only family member to survive," she says, with tears in her eyes. As she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo. Ly embraces her sister and both women sob. "I missed you so much," Ly says. "I've always searched for you," Bo tells her. Since production began five years ago, the television show, "It's Not A Dream," has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help. The series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history. "The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia," said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult. She described the country as a "land of orphans." For decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims. In large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts. Far from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades. After fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west. They continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative. "In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades," said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies. Craig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that "for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room." The silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, "lacked the vocabulary" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society. The Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at "Year Zero" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy. "Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill," said Etcheson. "When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again." Even today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school. In an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said. Some were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the "killing fields" -- had really occurred, she added. The space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng. Founded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a "hybrid" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice. Intended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support. "We had great hope for this process," said Seng. "The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes." But the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.) This, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court. Seng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a "sham." For many victims, it is "too little, too late." OPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer Rouge . In the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. The court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's "Brother Number Two," and Khieu Samphan, "Brother Number Four," to life. Both men have appealed their convictions. In a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said. Two further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation. Three people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated. Olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004. Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal. Others are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings. Etcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an "imperfect vessel" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society. He said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society. "In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped," he added. Undoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece. Krisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die. "There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad," she said. Khieu Samphan, "Brother Number Four," published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his "Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual" in French in 2013. He told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound. "I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct," he said. For survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take. But for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet. On the stage of the "It's Not a Dream" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen. "Do you know the person in the video?" the show's host asks. "Yes," Ly says. "She is my mother." Moments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage. "Where have you two been?" Te asks. "I always worried about you two." "I thought you died," Ly says. The three women cry and embrace. "It is very miserable for all of us," the old woman says.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">A senior Indonesian government official has praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Mr Abbott announced Australia's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered. 'Australia respects the Indonesian system, we respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot simply be business as usual,' Mr Abbott said. 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect'. 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week,' Ms Bishop said. The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies. Ms Bishop hasn't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Australia gives Indonesia about $600 million in aid annually, and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan. Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget, Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador. 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May,' she told reporters in Canberra. Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important' relationship with Indonesia. 'But it has suffered as a result of what's been done over the last few hours,' he said. 'Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I'm sure that every Australian's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time.' The Prime Minister said he understood people's anger at the executions, but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse. 'So I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse,' he said. 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important, remains important, will always be important, will become more important as time goes by. 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts. 'I don't and we shouldn't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible," he said. 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists.' Backlash begins: At 6am AEST, hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia' Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians. President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott's phone calls on the issue. Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day, one of Australia's most solemn days of remembrance. The Bali Nine duo's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers. In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others,' it read. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' Following the executions, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings, with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost. Nothing gained' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day.' Greens Leader Christine Milne said: 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment.' Stern words: Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions, parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted: 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty #RIP', tweeted. He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott, who said: 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture. Murder is murder.' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia. But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight, killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia. Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal. 'Nepal needs it more,' said Mr Robertson, who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances. Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart, Tanya Plibersek (right), have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC's 730 program on Tuesday evening, Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government. 'I don't intend to focus on the consequences,' she said. 'But of course, should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate, of course there will be have to be consequences. I don't want to go into the details.' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap, paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment. Late on Tuesday evening, the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo. The statement said: 'It is not too late to change your mind.' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Alastair Cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as England captain showed how to do it. There was agony for Cook on the third day of the second Test as he again fell short of the magic three figures despite looking as solid and unflustered at the crease as at any time in the two years since his last century. But the problems Cook had in finding fluency in his 211-ball 76 were put into stark perspective by yet another display of the rare class and maturity that has made Joe Root England’s outstanding batsman. Joe Root celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second Test against the West Indies . England's Root smashes a short ball to the boundary as West Indies keeper and captain Denesh Ramdin can only watch on .

Root and Gary Ballance run between wickets as they easily work the West Indian bowling around on a hot day in Grenada . Ben Stokes is giving a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs . This has been another slow, attritional Test in conditions that are hardly conducive to entertaining cricket. Yet as soon as Root took guard, batting at Grenada’s National Stadium was suddenly taken to another level. There were no problems for the Yorkshireman in reaching three figures — his sixth Test century and his first overseas — and his average has now reached a hundred since his return to the England team last summer. Here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by Cook and Jonathan Trott to give England a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on West Indies on the final day. Only a late burst of madness which saw Moeen Ali run himself out and Ben Stokes hit a Devendra Bishoo long-hop straight down deep square leg’s throat spoilt England’s day. They ended on 373 for six, a lead of 74, and Root and Jos Buttler will have to stick around for as long as possible on Friday if England are going to dictate terms.

Trott appears disappointed after the conditions appeared to favour the batsmen after they'd done the hard work early on . Root ’s fastest hundred for England, coming from 125 balls and including 13 fours, two sixes. This is his sixth Test century for his country. First 100 scored overseas. His previous high was 87 in Adelaide against Australia in 2013. In the past year he has scored four Test centuries . Root is the fifth England batsman  to score six consecutive 50s in Test innings. Since June 2014 he has scored 1,037 runs, averaging 103.7 . Root has featured in five of England’s past six Test partnerships of 150-plus runs. Alastair Cook has gone 34 innings and 697 days without a Test ton. Root said: ‘We had a blip towards the end but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on. Build a partnership with Jos tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once. ‘My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips in your career and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.’ While Root was the star of the day, this was hardly a failure for an England captain who has now made four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings, but Cook would have given anything to have been able to add those extra, elusive 24 runs. The brutal reality is that only Mike Brearley among England captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than Cook’s 34 innings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all. It is now 697 days since Cook made the last of his record 25 Test centuries, at Headingley against New Zealand way back in 2013 when everything seemed well with the world of England and their captain. Here Cook and Trott recorded England’s first century opening partnership for 31 innings as England went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield. The second-slowest half-century of Trott’s career, which was reached off 137 balls, was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as Cook after his double failure in Antigua. If Trott’s wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg-spin of Bishoo to second slip then Cook seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another Ashes. Not only had he been dropped on 29 on the second evening but  he survived an lbw shout on 65 on Thursday by a whisker when the deserving Bishoo saw his review of Steve Davis’ not out decision deemed umpire’s call. Just when Cook was looking at his best after lunch, Shannon Gabriel went round the wicket, bowled short and wide and somehow forced Cook to inside edge an attempted cut into his stumps. He stood for a moment, hunched over his bat, before trudging off with a score worth perhaps 20 more because of the slowness of the outfield but one that to Cook will seem not nearly enough. Trott summed up the mood of frustration, saying: ‘Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but you don’t spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match-defining hundreds.’ When Ian Bell also chopped on to Gabriel, a sure sign of a slow surface, West Indies were back in the match and England’s nerves were starting to fray. Yet that was to underestimate the extraordinary potential of the two exciting and prolific young Yorkshire batsmen in England’s middle order. The lack of touch and confidence that Gary Ballance displayed in the World Cup now looks light years away as he has returned to the Test form that made him the ICC’s emerging player of 2014. Ballance made 122 in Antigua and carried on here, bringing an urgency to England’s innings that was lacking when they managed just 69 runs in an extended morning session. Cook stands and waits for the result of a West Indies decision review after an LBW appeal was judged not out by the on-field umpire .

Cook trudges off the field after a solid innings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left-handed opener . But if Ballance was busy then Root roistered along, reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125. He has been a class apart almost from the moment England recalled him, after leaving him out of the last Test of their Ashes humiliation, and restored him to the middle order where he belongs. This was his England record-equalling sixth successive Test score of 50 or more, a landmark shared with Patsy Hendren, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington and Cook himself. No Englishman has ever made seven in succession. At least not until Root bats again. Together, Root and Ballance took England beyond West Indies’ score after tea and added 165 before Marlon Samuels found a way through Ballance. The late flurry of activity, culminating in Stokes being given a salute as a send-off by his bete noire Samuels, reduced England’s chances of going to Barbados next week one up. But while there is Root, there is hope. A second drag-on for the St George's Day play came for England No 4 Ian Bell, who also cut Gabriel onto his off stump .

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the Iberian peninsula, stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers. Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El Mirón' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called El Mirón Cave in Cantabria between Santander and Bilbao. After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects.

They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. But the fact she was buried within the living quarters of her peers has led the anthropologists to suggest she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. This status is also hinted at due to the presence of a primitive tombstone. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif  that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. 'Could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block?' said the researchers in their paper '"The Red Lady of El Mirón". Lower Magdalenian life and death in Oldest Dryas Cantabrian Spain: an overview' published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. In addition there are lines engraved on the bedrock lower wall and ledge against which part of the corpse had been laid behind the block. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC . Experts suggest the so-called 'Red Lady' was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy'. She would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas' and ate ibex, red deer and salmon. Her body was interred at the rear of the cave (pictured) where her peers would have lived and slept . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted, and researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. But, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual . The eastern face of the block was additionally 'intensely stained' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found, creating a link between the block and body. 'The ochre may constitute the only demonstrable “grave offering”,' continued the researchers. 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mirón. 'The corpse seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall. 'The head  would have been at the northern end of the burial. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position. 'Because many of the bones are stained with red ochre, it is possible that either the woman's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and/or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual.' Anthropologists from the University of New Mexico said: 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mirón. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position [and] seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain (marked). Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide) The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria. During the excavations, a large engraved rock was found. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that has been said to represent a pubic triangle, suggesting a female was buried nearby. The eastern face of the block (shown on the left of this map) was also stained' with red ochre . After discovering a series of individual bones (plotted by red dots), researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed . In particular, its blood-red colour may have been symbolic of life and death. Following her burial, the anthropologists said the grave was partially disturbed by a wolf, or similar-sized carnivore. They then believe the skeleton was stained a second time and covered again. 'The scenario that is hypothesised is that the carnivore only minimally disturbed the skeleton, since the bones were unconnected by this time,' the experts continued. 'Then humans apparently found the exposed tibia and thus the rest of the skeleton. They may have removed the cranium and most of the largest bones without totally rearranging the fundamental anatomical order of the former corpse, whose hands may have been placed near her head and feet tucked under her bottom.' Using detailed mineralogical maps of the region, it is thought the Magdalenian people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern-day city of Santoña, situated around 12 miles (20km) from the cave. 'Although lacking in clear grave offerings, the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment,' concluded the researchers. 'But, at the end of the day, we are left with a mystery: who was the “Red Lady” of El Mirón and why was she given such special treatment after her death?'</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton . OCTOBER 2013 . Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014 . After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014 . England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014 . Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014 . Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014 . England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014 . England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014 . Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015 . England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015 . Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role . Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role . Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure . Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician . Verdict: Vulnerable . Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media . Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India.

Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible . Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much .</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-7-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">In one of the biggest cheating scandals of its kind in the U.S., 11 former Atlanta public school educators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering for their role in a scheme to inflate students' scores on standardized exams. The defendants - including teachers, a principal and other administrators - were accused of falsifying test results to collect bonuses or keep their jobs in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system. The educators fed answers to students or erased and changed the answers on tests after they were turned in to secure promotions or up to $5,000 each in bonuses, the court was told. However the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A 12th defendant, a teacher, was acquitted of all charges by the jury this week. The 11 will all be sentenced on April 8 and could face up to 20 years in prison for the racketeering charges. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses.

One principal was accused of wearing gloves as they erased test score answers and filled in new ones . 'This is a huge story and absolutely the biggest development in American education law since forever,' said University of Georgia law professor Ron Carlson. 'It has to send a message to educators here and broadly across the nation. Playing with student test scores is very, very dangerous business.' The case stems from an investigation carried out in 2011, which uncovered evidence that the educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, serve between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service, repay between $500 and $5,000 in bonus money and complete up to two years of probation. Others testified at the trial against their co-conspirators. However, Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer.

Emotional: Donald Bullock, left, former Atlanta Public Schools Usher-Collier Heights Elementary testing coordinator, reacts as a jury finds him guilty. He is now facing 20 years in prison . Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But, the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. Hall, who served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief, was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and was credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates. The investigation found that Hall 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' during her time as Superintendent. It also found that she had permitted 'cheating — at all levels — to go unchecked for years'. Investigators believe she may have accepted up to $500,000 in bonus payouts as a result of the ongoing cheating scandal. In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in .

It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 .

Guilty: Former Atlanta Public Schools school research team director Sharon Davis Williams, left, as the verdict is read in the  trial, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, in Atlanta. Defense attorneys argued that there was no conspiracy and that prosecutors had pressured educators to testify against their former colleagues . Guilty: Former Deerwood Academy assistant principal Tabeeka Jordan, left, stands with her defense attorney Akil Secret after a jury found her guilty . Former Dobbs Elementary teacher Angela Williamson, left, and her defense attorney Gerald Griggs stand as the verdict was read. Williamson and 10 other former Atlanta Public Schools educators were accused of participating in test cheating . In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal 'alarming' behavior'. Hall said: 'There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct.' Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. Yet, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon. The jury reached its verdict on the eighth day of deliberations. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter said: 'They are convicted felons as far as I'm concerned. They have made their bed and they're going to have to lie in it.'

Verdict: Defense attorney Annette Greene reacts as the verdict is read for her client former Dunbar Elementary teacher Shani Robinson. Robinson and 10 other former Atlanta Public Schools educators were convicted for their part  in a test cheating conspiracy that drew nationwide attention . Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of their students. Defense attorneys argued that their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable. Legal team: Fulton County Senior Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker, right, hugs Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard. Eleven of the 12 defendants left the courtroom in handcuffs . District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. It lasted nearly two years and involved hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. 'Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,' Howard said. Dessa Curb, a former elementary school teacher, was the one educator acquitted of all charges. 'I've prayed and I believed that this would be my outcome,' said a dazed-looking Curb, tears in her eyes.

And today, the Pulitzer prize for journalism went to The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, South Carolina  - which has a tiny staff of just 80 and a daily circulation of 85,000. The paper's powerful photo series entitled 'Till Death Do Us Part,' on domestic violence scooped the top award for its exploration into why South Carolina is among the deadliest states  for women. Scroll down for video . Winner: This iconic photo by New York Times photographer Daniel Berehulak, was part of a winning series, and shows James Dorbor, 8, suspected of being infected with Ebola, being carried by medical staff to an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia . Death: This photograph released by the Pulitzer Board on 20 April 2015 shows one of the winning photographs by Daniel Berehulak who won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography . The newspaper was awarded the gold medal for public service, the first time in five years that the prize has gone to such a small newspaper. Last year, the award went to The Washington Post and The Guardian for their coverage of National Security Agency documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden. Executive editor Mitch Pugh said reporters saw annual statistics which ranked South Carolina as the state where the most women are killed by men, according to The New York Times. 'The discussion around the table in the newsroom was why is that. We've written about it every year, but we've never done the deep dive.' The small newspaper's photographs were just one of many by news organizations which looked at the key news events which gripped the nation and international community over the past year. Some of the most vivid portraits came from the New York Times which ran a series of heartbreaking images of the Ebola outbreak as it gripped countries in West Africa. The newspaper won three Pulitzer prizes for international reporting and feature photography for its coverage of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. The Pulitzer committee at Columbia University in New York said The New York Times staff shared the prize for international reporting for its coverage of the deadly Ebola epidemic in west Africa. New York Times reporter Eric Lipton took the prize for investigative reporting on the influence of lobbyists. And freelance photographer for the paper, Daniel Berehulak, won the feature photography award for his Ebola coverage. Heartbreaking: This September 18, 2014, photo by New York Times photographer Daniel Berehulak, part of a winning series, shows Eric Gweah, 25, weeping as a burial team removes the body of his 62-year-old father, who died at home, arms thrashing and blood spewing from his mouth, in front of his sons after being turned away at the treatment centers in Monrovia, Liberia . Ebola: Another award winning photograph by New York Times photographer Daniel Berehulak shows a relative grieving as a Liberian Red Cross burial team dresses in protective clothing before removing the body of a suspected Ebola victim in central Monrovia, Liberia . The Pulitzer prizes, awarded annually by Columbia University, recognize extraordinary work in U.S. journalism, literature, drama, and other categories. The award is officially given out on April 20. Other winners of the coveted award included the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. It received the Pulitzer prize in photography for its coverage of the Ferguson, Missouri riots in the wake of the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Awards: This October 19 2014 photo by St. Louis Post Dispatch photographer David Carson shows Ferguson protester Cheyenne Green struggling to hold onto an American flag as a football fan makes a grab for it outside the Edward Jones Dome after a St. Louis Rams game .

The store was later set on fire . Photo: This August 13, 2014, photo by St. Louis Post Dispatch photographer Robert Cohen shows Edward Crawford returning a tear gas canister fired by police who were trying to disperse protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.  Four days earlier, unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death by white police officer Darren Wilson. The killing ignited riots and unrest in the St. Louis area and across the nation . The images managed to capture the despair and anger felt by residents in the small town after the shooting of the black teenager by Wilson. Other winners included The Seattle Times staff for its coverage of a deadly landslide. The Wall Street Journal was also honored for 'Medicare Unmasked,' and Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig received praise for coverage of security lapses at the Secret Service. Author, Anthony Doerr [Scribner], won the top prize in fiction for 'All the Light We Cannot See' an imaginative and intricate novel inspired by the horrors of World War II. The book follows a blind French girl who joins the resistance movement and an orphaned German boy who gets swept up in the Nazi occupation. He was praised for writing in short, elegant chapters that explored human nature and the contradictory power of technology.

Investigative Reporting: The Wall Street Journal staff for 'Medicare Unmasked,' a pioneering project that gave Americans unprecedented access to previously confidential data on the motivations and practices of their health care providers; and Eric Lipton, of The New York Times, for reporting that showed how the influence of lobbyists can sway congressional leaders and state attorneys general, slanting justice toward the wealthy and connected. Explanatory Reporting: Zachary R. Mider, of Bloomberg News, for a painstaking, clear and entertaining explanation of how so many U.S. corporations dodge taxes and why lawmakers and regulators have a hard time stopping them.

Feature Photography: Daniel Berehulak, freelance photographer for The New York Times, for his gripping, courageous photographs of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">It may still be April, but Britain looks set to get an early dose of summer sun. Temperatures are due to rise throughout today peaking at 22C (72F) tomorrow. Not only will that be the warmest temperature recorded this year, but it will also surpass the average daytime temperature for August. That is 11C warmer than the UK April average and would beat the current 2015 high of 20.7C (69F) on Easter Sunday in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. The 22C (72F) predicted in the South East on Friday is also better than the 18C forecast in Marbella, 16C in Rhodes, 10C in Istanbul and 16C in Malta.

Sandcastles galore: People relax on the beach in Broadstairs, Kent, as fine weather continues across the UK . Meanwhile the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs has issued a warning to asthma sufferers of 'very high' air pollution tomorrow. Its warning for the far South East of England also states that adults and children with lung problems should avoid strenuous physical activity. Experts said locally-emitted pollution that would normally blow away will become trapped to the ground for longer, because there will be little wind. A Defra spokesman stressed the high pollution is not a direct result of the warm weather, but a mixture of factors including the arrival of Saharan dust. British Lung Foundation chief executive Penny Woods said it could 'put people living with respiratory conditions at risk of worsening symptoms'. Retailers have been stocking up on picnic food, with customers expected to head to beaches and parks for the last days of the school holidays. Three-day forecast: The weather will stay mostly dry and sunny  for the next few days, although some showers are expected on Saturday .

Morrisons said it expects barbecue essentials to fly off the shelves, and Waitrose sold a week’s worth of barbecue fuel on Easter Monday. But anyone hoping to head further afield could find themselves stranded, as a French air traffic control strike has left airports in disarray. Forecasters expect the UK to see high temperatures until the weekend - while yesterday’s national maximum was 19.3C (67F) in Usk, South Wales. Clear skies, lengthening days and a warm mass of air from southern Europe will create glorious weather for the country as the sun shines through. The weather will stay mostly dry and sunny across the UK for the next few days, although some showers are expected from late tomorrow. Among the best coastal destinations for warm weather tomorrow will be Hunstanton in Norfolk, Whitstable in Kent and Prestatyn in North Wales.

Spring time: Women and children picnic at Royal Victoria Park in Bath as the warm weather continues across Britain yesterday . Air pollution levels tomorrow are forecast to be ‘very high’ in the far South East of England - potentially putting asthma sufferers at risk. The guidance from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs affects people on the Sussex coast in towns including Hastings, Bexhill and Eastbourne. ‘Adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems, and older people, should avoid strenuous physical activity,' it says. Meanwhile people with asthma ‘may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often’. Defra said that conditions will see 'locally-emitted pollution become trapped to the ground, because there's not so much wind'. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Basically we've seen local pollution and it's a mixture of that with some air coming in from the continent and a little bit of Saharan dust. It will just be on Friday that we see "very high" measurements, and it's due to clear up by 6am on Saturday.' Met Office meteorologist Dan Williams said: ‘We are looking at high temperatures for most days until the weekend.’ He added: ‘Friday is looking like the warmest day of the week - we may well see 21C (70F) or higher in London.’ England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each had their warmest days of 2015 over Easter, but those records could all be broken by tomorrow. The average UK temperature for April is 11.4C (52F) and for England is 12.4C (54F), according to the Met Office. Meanwhile safety charities warned people not to be tempted to swim in reservoirs or from unmonitored beaches during the warm weather. Some 400 people drown in the UK each year, the equivalent of one every 20 hours. In times of good weather drownings peak, charities said. And Morrisons said it expects barbecue essentials to fly off the shelves this weekend as the UK basks in some early spring sunshine. The Bradford-based retailer is predicting it will make and sell 1.4million fresh British beef burgers - a 30 per cent rise on last week. It also said sales of sausages made at its own manufacturing sites are expected to exceed 1million, while 1.6million burger buns will be baked. Morrisons added that this week it will sell half a million pegs and 62 miles of washing lines - enough to stretch from London to Cambridge. Waitrose said its rosé wine sales are up 24 per cent, strawberries are up 32 per cent, and a week’s worth of barbecue fuel was sold on Easter Monday. A spokesman added: ‘Shoppers are making the most of the change in temperature and stocking up on summery food and drinks.’ Reflection: A spring morning by Anish Kapoor's  Temenos sculpture, on the south bank of the Tees in Middlesbrough .

A spokesman for the supermarket added that sales of muffin tins have risen by a whopping 350 per cent, while dinnerware is up by 35 per cent. M&S said sales of its Grill range including burgers and ‘Posh Dogs’ are expected to rise by 30 per cent as people plan barbecues in the warm weather. A spokesman added: ‘It is expected that our prepared salads sales will increase by 35 per cent as people are looking for lighter options.’ Finally, Aldi said it expects sales of its premium Aberdeen Angus beef burgers to increase by 25 per cent as customers fire up their barbecues.</div></td></tr><tr>

Quarterback Tom Brady updated his Facebook page on Wednesday with a picture of himself lying in a hospital bed in a full body cast. He had shared a video on Saturday of himself jumping off a cliff into a river during his vacation. But according to the caption, it wasn't the cliff jump that got him but Michael Jordan, who was spotted playing some pick-up ball with the football player several days ago.

The NFL star was not the only one in the mood for pranks on April 1. Kelly Ripa and husband Mark Consuelos, who was co-hosting for Michael Strahan, pulled off a brilliant April Fool as they co-hosted Live! With Kelly And Michael on Wednesday morning. Kelly, 44, told the studio audience that she wanted to address the latest rumors swirling in the media that she's expecting her fourth child. She picked up what looked like a press release and began reading it, confirming that she and Mark were indeed expecting another baby due in early 2016. The couple are already parents to a daughter Lola and sons Michael and Joaquin. Kelly said they'd been trying to keep the news quiet because it's so early in the pregnancy and because she's so old and after she confirmed the pregnancy, the audience broke out in loud applause and cheers. Then the show's executive producer Michael Gelman threw a large piece of cardboard at the TV host which she caught and turned it around to reveal the words: 'April Fools,' prompting groans of disappointment and laughter from the fans.

Teach For America announced on April 1 via its Facebook page that Zayn Malik, who dramatically quit One Direction this week, has agreed to join them as a teacher now he's left the boy band. The organization recruits young people to work as teachers in impoverished communities across the U.S. in an effort to make sure that all kids, regardless of socio-economic status, have the chance of a good education. 'We believe that Zayn’s experiences being both revered and ridiculed by teens and preteens and surviving Simon Cowell’s management - not to mention the overall Story of His Life - will equip him well for success in the classroom,' Teach For America said on Facebook. A new direction: Teach For America, that recruits young people to work as teachers in poor communities across the U.S., announced Wednesday that Zayn Malik is joining them after leaving One Direction .

The search engine revealed a mirror-image version of its homepage, which can be accessed by typing in com.google and shows search results flipped around. It also jumped on the selfie bandwagon, announcing a new service allowing users to share instant photographic reactions to any website they visit. And the site's 'Fiber' division, which is rolling out high-speed internet across the U.S., claimed to have a new dial-up mode which replicates the experience of using the web 20 years ago in order to induce a feeling of zen-like calm. Shoe company Miz Mooz made fun of selfie sticks with its 'selfie shoes', footwear with a hole in the end which can fit a smartphone in. Pizza Hut chose the first of the month to launch its 'scratch and sniff' menus which are sure to be a big hit . Domino's was among the companies to make April Fool's announcements, posting a video on Vine of its new 'Domi-No-Driver', a drone motorcycle which can deliver pizzas without any human intervention. Qantas Airlines also announced that it was 'No longer a ‘Q without a U’ due to the confusion with its company name. Samsung introduced the Galaxy Blade edge - because what home is complete without a smart knife with smartphone capabilities? According to the April 1 ad, it has all the features of the Galaxy S6 phone along with the practical razor-sharp diamond edge of a kitchen knife. 'The Blade edge is a safe knife,' Samsung wrote. 'It's got a finger detection mechanism that prevents it from cutting human skin, while anti-virus protection alerts you whenever unwanted germs are detected in your ingredients.' PetCo came up with the ingenious idea of a selfie stick for dogs which launched on Wednesday - but don't rush to buy it in store any time soon. Pizza Hut put out a picture of enthusiastic, if a little gullible, customers trying out its new 'scratch and sniff' menu. Dating app Hinge also launched their latest product on Wednesday - 'Playdating: Hinge for Toddlers.' Justin, the founder and CEO, said in an interview: 'We thought, wow, 97 per cent of people between the ages of two and five are single.' And not to be outdone, the Angry Birds birds app launched a new version, 'Agri Birds', with the tagline: 'Welcome to your new summer job at Agri Birds Farm. Plough the fields, tend to your crops, and trade goods with neighbors and friends to save your farm from being bulldozed by the dastardly bigshot – Mighty Bagel.' Drone: An image of the 'Domi-No-Driver', which supposedly delivers pizza without human intervention . Ashton Kutcher wasn't going to be left out of the fun on Wednesday and the Punk'd star enjoyed himself pranking visitors to his website, aplus.com. The 37-year-old actor and entrepreneur tricked mobile phone users into thinking they were getting  a personal call from Kutcher himself after they scrolled to the bottom of articles on the site. Those who answered the faux ring were directed to a screen that showed the actor pointing and laughing at them with the message, 'April Fools. Trick Your Friends.' Other celebrities took part in an April Fools Day joke that promoted a revolutionary 1.5 second looping video site Dips. The spoof website featured a host of famous faces who appeared to be backing a new $80 million start up that shares 'blink of an eye' clips hosted by Funny Or Die. In the clip, a bedraggled Jennifer Lawrence picks up a banana as if it's a phone and Britney Spears walks straight into a glass sliding door.

In other April 1 pranks on Wednesday,  the latest celebrity couple 'Drarry' went public - sending Harry Potter fans into a frenzy after Tom Felton posted a shop of him and Daniel Radcliffe lying head-to-head with the caption: 'May as well just say it. We're together now x #drarry.' In the UK, The Guardian newspaper reported that disgraced Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson had renounced his gas-guzzling ways after a 'dark night of the soul', and decided he wanted to devote his post-Top Gear life to campaigning against carbon emissions. He supposedly said he would start driving a Toyota Prius, and wanted the speed limit lowered. 'There comes a time when a man's got to ask himself what he really stands for,' Mr Clarkson is quoted as saying. 'And for me, that's sustainable energy, traffic calming and an end to xenophobia and prejudice.' The Sun newspaper claimed that Simon Cowell and Helen Mirren would be replacing the Queen's face on British pound notes in the near future.

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-11-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">Revealed: Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, the owner of the stripy Kensington property, may be worth up to £60million and has fallen out with her family over inheritance . The woman accused of painting red and white stripes on her £15million Kensington townhouse in a bitter planning row  is a war hero's daughter worth as much as £60million who has fallen out with her family over inheritance. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring has been accused by critics in her west London neighbourhood of ordering the dramatic overnight paint job ‘to get her own back’ when they objected to her plans to demolish the property and rebuild it with a two-storey ‘iceberg’ basement. Residents in the otherwise immaculate cobbled cul-de-sac in Kensington, one of the city’s wealthiest areas, said the colourful redesign was driving them ‘mad’ and likened Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, believed to be in her early 70s, to ‘a child throwing a tantrum’. Today MailOnline can reveal Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring has also fallen out with the family of her late husband Robert, who have accused her of failing to pass on cash and property worth millions after his death in 2007. Robert Lisle, her stepson, said her behaviour does not surprise him, having last had contact with her in 2012 when they continued to row over the inheritance he believes is due to him and the wider family. He said: ‘She has made commitments and reneged on them. She’s an extremely unpleasant character'. His wife Sally claims Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring's  life revolves around money, which has left her estranged from much of her family. She said: 'She's fallen out with the family. It's sad, she is missing out on them growing up and getting married. But she's not involved because of her decisions. 'Her husband promised money and property to his children and grandchildren but after he died it never materialised. They were promises my husband's father made, but she has never kept one. 'She's so rude, in fact she is the rudest person I've ever met. 'Money is not our god - but money is her god. We don't need it to be happy, we are already, but it is for her. She's got nothing else in her life, no friends, just her and her money'. Ms Lisle-Mainwaring's original name is understood to be Patricia Royde, who later changed her name to Zipporah - the name of Moses' wife - because of 'vanity', her family claim. She is the daughter of a Second World War hero pilot, Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, who was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board. But in 1943 he was shot down over Belgium while heading to bomb German factories and buried in the Schoonselhof Cemetery. In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring helped unveiled a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost. Neighbours of a £15million townhouse in South End, Kensington - one of the most exclusive areas of London - have branded the property an ‘eyesore’ after it was painted with red and white stripes following objections to knock it down and replace it with a five-storey mansion . Memorial: In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, second from right, helped unveil a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost when his RAF plane was shot down in 1943 . Residents surrounding her stripy Kensington townhouse told MailOnline they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, and likened it to a ‘beachside hut’. Planning documents show Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring wanted to replace the property with a five-storey ‘traditional mews-style’ home, including a two-story basement complete with gym, media room and swimming pool with a double-height ceiling. The new property could be worth £25million. Hero: Her father Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board . The plans were initially turned down by Kensington and Chelsea Council but approved on appeal. However, a neighbour then lodged a legal challenge which means the case will go to the High Court in June where a final decision will be made. Residents now believe that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, a property developer, ordered the garish paint job - which took place under the cover of darkness - as an act of revenge for the legal challenge. While Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s solicitors refused to comment yesterday on the motives behind the dramatic paint job, there is little doubt that it has rubbed the objecting neighbours up the wrong way. Saskia Moyle, 18, who lives opposite the house with her father, said the new colourful exterior had not gone down well with local residents, with the majority complaining that it lowers the classy tone of the quiet cobbled street. She told MailOnline: 'The neighbours are all horrendously unhappy with it. Everyone's complained. We all hate it. It's a bit of an eyesore. 'The woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it'. Colin Burchett, a chauffeur who works from the neighbouring road, said the property had been receiving lots of attention from tourists, who now regularly visit the quaint street to take photos. He said: ‘In terms of the paint job, I just think it’s really bizarre. I’d like to know how they have got away with it. ‘Surely it’s a listed building or there must be restrictions. All of the windows on the street are exactly the same and when another property in the road wanted some work done there was a notice up for ages. I can’t see how they’ve got away with it.’ The owner of the £15million Kensington townhouse was once involved in a high-profile legal challenge over another property dispute. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, along with her husband Robert - who died in 2007, four years into the marriage -, was the owner of Yeoman's Row Management Limited which became embroiled in a legal battle with property developer Mr Cobbe. The dispute began in 2002 when Mr Cobbe verbally agreed to buy and redevelop a block of 13 flats in Knightsbridge owned by Yeoman's. At his own expense, it was decided that he would apply for planning permission for the development to turn the flats into six terraced houses. Residents said they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, which suddenly appeared after legal challenges thwarted a planning application to give the home a double basement to include a swimming pool . The house (pictured centre before the paint job which occurred in the last couple of weeks) was bought by Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring several years ago and turned from office space into storage space. She now wants to turn it into a residential property measuring five-storeys . Ms Lisle-Mainwaring has submitted several planning applications but ultimately wishes to demolish the current property and rebuild it to take it from three-storeys to five-storeys with a double basement below ground. It will include four bedrooms, a gym, pool and media room . The company would then sell Mr Cobbe the property for £12million upon the planning application being successful, and when the work was completed, he would have to give Yeoman's 50 per cent of the profits if the sale was in excess of £24million. If the planning application was not successful, Mr Cobbe would receive no payment. The contract was purely verbal and there was no written formal agreement or the instruction of lawyers. Mr Cobbe spent about £200,000 obtaining planning permission between 2002 and 2004 and, on the day after the consent was granted, Yeoman's told him the agreement no longer stood. The firm claimed the agreement had lapsed as the consent had not been obtained within a set period of time and refused to sell him the land. Mr Cobbe started legal proceedings, claiming the company had breached the verbal contract, and the case went to the High Court. He said he should be paid for the work he carried out to obtain planning permission and also claimed a right to the land since its value had increased considerably thanks to the planning consent. The Court of Appeal ruled to award Mr Cobbe a sum in excess of £5million but the House of Lords overturned the decision, claiming Mr Cobbe was not entitled to ‘property estoppel’ because he did not have a formal contract. However, the Lords ruled that Mr Cobbe was entitled to a sum for 'unjust enrichment' and he was awarded around £200,000 to cover the cost of obtaining planning permission and a fee for his services. During the case, the Chancery Division and the Court of Appeal criticised Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s conduct as ‘unconscionable’ and ‘unpleasant’. Afterwards, solicitors Clarke Wilmott said the fact Mr Cobbe had only been paid for his time and expenses meant Ms Lisle-Mainwaring was ‘laughing all the way to the bank’. The Knightsbridge development, which is currently under construction, was described in objection letters by residents as something which would cause ‘irreparable damage’ to the ‘quality of life and sense of community’ on the street while ‘solely benefiting the commercial developers’. Yeoman's Row Management Limited is no longer active and it is understood Ms Lisle-Mainwaring now splits her time between the UK and Switzerland, with properties registered in London and Geneva. Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring was unavailable for comment today but her solicitor said her Kensington home was not bought for £15million and would not be worth £25million if the two years of proposed work is completed. He also denied claims by neighbours the stripes were painted during the night, backed up by the man who painted them. The tradesman, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline: 'It's not true it was painted during the night. I did it in five hours during the day around six weeks ago. I wasn't told why I had to do it, but I read in the newspapers it was to do with the neighbours'.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">She might be celebrating her 75th birthday, but an overjoyed Queen Margrethe of Denmark looked far younger as she waved to excited crowds from the balcony at the Amalienborg Palace. The Danish monarch was joined on the balcony by her sons, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Prince Joachim, 45, who were with her again for a procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Københavns Rådhus [city hall] for a slap-up lunch. And the two were by Margrethe's side once again in the evening when the Danish royals welcomed royals from all corners of Europe to Fredensborg Castle for a gala banquet followed by a magnificent fireworks display. Early arrivals: Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark were among the first guests to arrive for the gala dinner .

Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie chose a floor-length ivory dress covered in delicate beads . Joining them was Frederik's Australian-born wife Mary, 43, who opted for a striking silver gown featuring a neat high neckline and dramatic blouson sleeves. Margrethe's other daughter-in-law, the French-born Princess Marie, 39, was also at Fredensborg and looked wonderful in a floor-length cream beaded gown. Other members of the Danish Royal Family to attend the event included Margrethe's sister Princess Benedikte, 70, who chose a summery floral dress with a square neck and sheer train. As with Wednesday night's lavish dinner at Christiansborg Palace, Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt  was on the guest list and cut a dramatic figure in a heavily sequinned black and nude dress. But while socialist politician Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour MP Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, caught the eye, it was the many royals in attendance who took centre stage.

From Sweden came the country's King Carl XVI Gustaf and his glamorous Brazilian-born wife Silvia, who arrived with Crown Princess Victoria, 37, who looked ravishing in a spectacular sequinned dress. The Norwegian Royal Family was represented by dashing Crown Prince Haakon, 41, who had arrived in the Danish capital earlier that day to mark Queen Margrethe's birthday alongside his wife, the ice blonde Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Margrethe's birthday celebrations had kicked off with a touching family wake-up call, which saw Margrethe's two sons and their families join crowned heads from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to sing traditional Danish folk songs beneath her window. Next on her agenda was an appearance on the balcony of the Amalienborg Palace alongside her son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, his wife Crown Princess Mary, 43, and their four children. Waiting below was an enormous flag-waving crowd who went into raptures as the royals appeared, watched by members of other European royal dynasties, among them Sweden's and Norway's. Also on the balcony was Margrethe's second son, Joachim, 45, his French wife Princess Marie, his children from his first marriage, Nikolai, 15, and Felix, 12, and his youngest two, Henrik, five, Athena, three. One royal who couldn't be present on the balcony or for the gala dinner at Fredensborg that followed was Margrethe's 80-year-old husband Prince Henrik who, according to palace officials, is suffering from flu. The French-born royal also missed the carriage procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Rådhus and was replaced for the day by his son Frederik. Royal wave: Queen Margrethe is flanked by her sons Frederik and Joachim as she waves to the crowds . Celebrating: Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik, his wife Mary and their nine-year-old son Prince Christian on the balcony .

Despite being without Prince Henrik, the appearance proved a cheerful affair - largely thanks to the antics of four-year-old Prince Vincent, who did his best to scale the railings of the balcony. Held back by his father, the youngster smiled mischievously and was quickly copied by his twin sister Josephine - much to their mother Princess Mary's amusement. Australian-born Mary, who was elegant in a navy ensemble topped with a grey cocktail hat, certainly appeared to be enjoying the moment, smiling broadly as she stood with her four children. Frederik, meanwhile, was content to wave to the crowd and at one point leaned down to whisper in the ear of his older son, nine-year-old Prince Christian. Girls together: Prince Joachim holds his three-year-old daughter Athena, while Crown Princess Mary clutches four-year-old Josephine .

Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, the youngest reigning royals in Europe, led the way in, followed by the equally glamorous King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands. Norway's King Harald, who joined the Danish royals on the balcony, was accompanied by his wife Queen Sonia, and his son Crown Prince Haakon and daughter-in-law Mette Marit. Sweden's 65-year-old King Carl XIV Gustaf also brought his heir, in his case Crown Princess Victoria, 38, and her former personal trainer husband, Prince Daniel. Other royals to attend included the elegant Queen Mathilde of the Belgians who shimmered in a stunning purple gown at Wednesday night's event and smiled broadly as she made her way inside on the arm of husband King Philippe.

Scroll down for video . 'Lack of discipline': Some of the 2,500 police officers who were involved in tracking down the Boston Marathon bombers showed a lack of 'weapons discipline' during two firefights with the brothers, a new report reveals . Brothers: In the first standoff, the officers fired 'toward the vicinity' of Tamerlan (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) 'without necessarily having identified and lined up their target', the 130-page document states . Official report: They also reportedly failed to appropriately aim their guns. Amid their chaotic shooting, transit cop Richard Donohue was critically wounded. Above, the After Action Report, which was released on Friday . The unmarked black pickup truck had been 'erroneously reported as stolen'. It was 'spotted driving on Adams Street, near the scene of the shootout, and fired upon by an officer,' the report states. Upon closer inspection, the officer discovered that the occupants of the vehicle were a Boston Police Department officer and a Massachusetts State Police trooper in plain clothing, the document says. Fortunately, both officers were unhurt. Then, later in the night, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. This caused 'many officers to fire at the boat in the belief they were being shot by the suspect,' says the long-awaited report by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, released Friday. The two standoffs and the car incident all created 'dangerous crossfire situations'. But despite the findings, the report praises many other aspects of the emergency response to the April 15 attacks. Firefight: Shortly after the firefight (pictured) in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2013 - which resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev - an officer mistakenly fired on a police vehicle carrying two other cops . Suspect: Then, later in the night, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. Above, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is pictured clutching his chest after emerging from the boat he was hiding in . Timeline: This graphic, featured in the report, details the timing of the two bombs and the following incidents . The document particularly highlights the response of medical personnel at the scene and Boston hospitals who treated injured bombing victims, 16 of whom suffered 'traumatic amputations'. 'The hospitals that received patients rendered life-saving medical care; as a result, every patient that was transported to a hospital from the scene survived,' the report states. 'Overall, the response to the Boston Marathon bombings must be considered a great success.' Best practices . Areas in need of improvement . Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line. A further 264 people were wounded in the worst attack on US soil since the 9/11 terrorist atrocity. The new report starts by explaining how April 15 was 'the perfect day for running'. The 'air was cool', the 'sun was shining', and the logistics supporting the marathon were 'operating smoothly', it says. But at 2.49pm, however, 'the race was forever changed', it adds. The first of the brothers' two IEDs detonated at 671 Boylston Street. Thirteen seconds later, 180 yards up, the second exploded. While victims were rushed to hospital, authorities immediately cordoned off a 15-block crime scene area, the report says. A large number of abandoned bags and packages were also screened. The document praises the actions of law enforcement in reacting to 61 reports of suspicious packages in the hours after the bombings - and hundreds more reports in following days. But it notes that many victims in hospital found 'the large numbers of heavily armed police officers and investigators' who were providing security in the building 'to be intimidating'. The patients were left 'frightened' after the officers questioned their families and friends, and collected their cell phones and other evidence, the document states. Explosion: Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line (pictured) 'Lack of coordination': The report reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout . Criticism: It also states that the two shootouts and the car incident created 'dangerous crossfire situations' In relation to the first shootout with the suspects in Watertown, the report explains how the standoff followed the fatal shooting of Sean Collier, a MIT police officer, and a carjacking in Cambridge. During the incident, officers lined both sides of a narrow residential street and began firing at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he fled the scene, resulting in a 'dangerous crossfire situation'. 'Weapons discipline was lacking by the multitude of law enforcement officers in the field during... the firefight with the two suspects near Dexter and Laurel Streets,' the report states of the shootout. 'Although initial responding officers practiced appropriate weapons discipline while they were engaged in the firefight with the suspects, additional officers arriving on scene near the conclusion of the firefight fired weapons toward the vicinity of the suspects, without necessarily having identified and lined up their target,' or appropriately aiming their guns. 'Officers lining both sides of the street also fired upon the second suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle.' A timeline of events in the report notes Donohue was shot as the surviving suspect fled. Chilling: Little Martin, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15. Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . Victims: Martin (left) was cheering on runners with his family. Right, Lingzi Lu (right) also died in the bombings . The report does not name any of the officers involved in the April 19 incident. More than a dozen officers suffered minor injuries during the deadly shootout, which followed a four-day manhunt. Although officials had deliberated whether to release photos of the suspects at the time, 'weighing concerns about the suspects fleeing and the general safety of the public', they ultimately did so. Donohue only survived after his colleagues at the scene tended to 'slow the bleeding with pressure and a tourniquet', says the report, congratulating the other officers on their life-saving efforts. He was then rushed to hospital, where had to be resuscitated, before eventually recovering. The report shows that initial responding Watertown police officers failed to remove their patrol rifles from the secure mount in their vehicles because the rifles were 'rarely used and securely locked'. It also reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout. Labels: This picture, featured in the report, shows the labels that were placed on victims after the bombings . On trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in a sketch on March 5), who was arrested after stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath . Many of these cops had 'self-deployed,' the 'After Action Report' states. The chaos was blamed on the lack of a 'single, integrated, comprehensive operational plan for all public safety organizations'. And it notes that Massachusetts Army National Guard soldiers deployed to help police in their efforts to track down the suspects were unarmed due to 'policy of the Commonwealth and the MANG'. This left them reliant on police, 'increasing the risk to both soldiers and officers', the report says. However, the document praises the efforts of the EMS system and officials' successful coordination. 'This coordination resulted in no one single hospital in the area being overwhelmed,' it says. On Friday, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh told NBC in a statement  that he was proud of the elements that the report praised and that the city would learn from the areas highlighted for improvement. 'I know that over the past two years city departments have worked together diligently to take the lessons learned from the bombings and drastically improve our emergency response protocols so we are even better prepared for the future, and we can set the example for other cities,' he said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was arrested after stepping out of the boat under which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath. Some of the charges could carry the death penalty. His lawyer admitted in opening statements that he had participated in the bombings but argued that his late brother was the mastermind. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed earlier that night during the initial shootout with police after he was ran over by an SUV, apparently driven by his brother. He had also been shot multiple times . Closing arguments for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's case are scheduled for Monday in US District Court.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The Red Cross hopes to bring vital medical supplies and aid workers into Yemen  after receiving approval from the Saudi-led military coalition, an ICRC spokeswoman said. The aid agency has been negotiating for a week to deliver life-saving supplies and equipment to Yemen, where the coalition has conducted 11 days of air strikes against Iran-backed Shi'ite Houthis. The coalition now controls the country's ports and air space. The UN last week said that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen. On Saturday it called for a 24-hour humanitarian pause in the conflict to allow aid to reach people cut off by air strikes and to save the lives of 'streams of wounded'. But hopes of getting aid into the country by tomorrow are fading, as they seek clearance from Arab states waging the air strikes and hunt for planes prepared to fly to Yemen. Air strikes: It is thought about 500 people have been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen - but so far, the International Red Cross has not been able to gain entry to the Middle Eastern country . Carnage: The aid agency has been negotiating for a week to deliver life-saving supplies and equipment to Yemen, where the coalition has conducted 11 days of air strikes against Iran-backed Shi'ite Houthis . People stand on the rubble of houses destroyed by an air strike in Okash village near Sanaa over the weekend . Supporters of the Houthi rebels raise rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa . Discussions: Pakistan is currently in talks about whether to enter the conflict - but the country's political leaders, like Imran Khan, who leads Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) party,  are urging diplomacy . 'Dialogue for peace': Members of Pakistan's civil society chant slogans against the Saudi-led coalition targeting Shiite rebels in Yemen, during a demonstration, in Lahore . 'We are still working on getting the plane to [the Yemeni capital] Sanaa. It's a bit difficult with the logistics because there are not that many companies or cargo planes willing to fly into a conflict zone,' said Marie Claire Feghali, a Red Cross spokesperson. The ICRC is aiming to get 48 tonnes of medical supplies into Yemen by plane. It is also trying to get staff by boat from Djibouti to Aden, but fighting has complicated efforts. Earlier today in Riyadh, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said arrangements had been made for at least one Red Cross aid delivery yesterday morning, but the ICRC - which deploys 300 aid workers to the Arab peninsula's poorest country - had pulled out of the arrangement. 'There was a trip fixed for them at nine this morning ... They informed us, after the time was set, of a request to delay the flight,' Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri told reporters yesterday, adding that this was because the company from which they had chartered the plane could not fly to Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition says it has set up a special coordination body for aid deliveries and asked NGOs and governments to work with it to ensure humanitarian aid can be brought into Yemen and foreign nationals can be evacuated safely. The news comes on the same day as war-weary Pakistan began talks to enter the conflict after its staunch Saudi allies issued an urgent request the country join the expanding coalition of Sunni Muslim nations fighting Shiite rebels in the country. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the special session of parliament last week, saying any decision on intervention could only come after proper debate. However, Pakistan's political leaders - including former cricketer Imran Khan, the head of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) party - are calling for diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, saying it does not want to get involved in any conflict that would inflame sectarian tensions.

This morning Pakistan's parliament begins . debating a Saudi plea for military help in Yemen - a . request that pits Prime Minister Sharif's Saudi . allies against a war-weary Pakistani public. Since Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's main Sunni Muslim power, . asked Sunni-majority Pakistan to join a Saudi-led military . coalition that began conducting air strikes last month against . largely Shi'ite Houthi forces in Yemen, Sharif has hedged his . bets. He has said repeatedly he will defend any threat to Saudi . Arabia's 'territorial integrity' without defining what action . such a threat might provoke. 'They're looking to satisfy Saudi expectations at a minimal . level,' said Arif Rafiq, a Washington-based adjunct scholar with . the Middle East Institute. 'They're unlikely to be part of any . meaningful action inside Yemen. Maybe they will reinforce the . (Saudi) border.' Twelve days of fighting has not only killed hundreds of people, but cut off water and electricity and led UNICEF to warn Yemen is heading towards a humanitarian disaster. For the people trapped between the warring sides, the arrival of the ICRC could not come soon enough. Street fighting and heavy shelling have torn through the streets of In Aden - the last bastion of support for the Saudi-backed Hadi - for days. Sixty people were killed in heavy fighting on Sunday alone, according to reports. Residents claim a foreign warship had shelled Houthi positions on the outskirts, but a spokesman for the coalition in Riyadh said its vessels were helping civilian evacuations, not shelling the Houthis. Nevertheless, food, water and electricity shortages have mounted across the city, where combat has shut ports and cut land routes from the city. 'How are we supposed to live without water and electricity?' pleaded Fatima, a housewife walking through the city streets with her young children. She clutched a yellow plastic jerry can, like dozens of other residents on the streets and in queues seeking water from public wells or mosque faucets after supplies at home dried up. In Dahlea, just north of the city, air strikes hit a local government compound and a military base on its outskirts, which were both taken over by Houthis. Residents said buildings were on fire and reported loud explosions. But militia fighters said coalition planes also dropped supplies - the first time they had done so outside Aden - including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, rifles, ammunition, telecommunications equipment and night goggles. Residents near al-Anad air base, once home to U.S. military personnel fighting a covert drone war with al Qaeda in Yemen, said dozens of Houthi and allied fighters were withdrawing north after the site was bombed by coalition jets. Meanwhile, at least eight people were killed in an air strike before dawn in the suburbs of the northern city of Saadah, home of the Houthi movement which spread from its mountain stronghold to take over the capital Sanaa six months ago. A Houthi spokesman said the dead included women and children. Local officials said strikes also hit air defence and coastal military units near the Red Sea port of Hodaida, and targets on the outskirts of Aden. They also hit a bridge on the road south to Aden, apparently trying to block the Houthis from sending reinforcements to their fighters in the city.

The Iranian foreign minister will visit Pakistan this week. A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran.</div></td></tr><tr>

'We also had a moment's silence to think about Karen's life, what we knew of her, about her family and to wish them the best.' The case has touched many people in Scotland and Ireland, with services held in Miss Buckley's home town of Cork earlier this week. Barry Ahearn, who is originally from Cork but now lives in Scotland, travelled from his home in Ayr to pay his respects to Miss Buckley in George Square. As organisers appealed for anyone who wanted to address the large crowd, Mr Ahearn sang a local Cork song. He said: 'I've been living in Scotland for the last four years and wanted to come today to show solidarity and support for Karen's family.

'There's a great number of people here tonight who I'm sure feel the same and we just want to rally round the Buckley family.'

Two women wipe away tears as they take part in the memorial. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University . Politicians took time out of campaigning earlier today to offer their condolences to the Buckley family. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'My thoughts are very much with the family and friends of Karen Buckley.' Jim Murphy began Labour's Scottish manifesto launch in Glasgow by saying: 'My thoughts and the thoughts of everyone in the room go out to Karen's family. None of us can in anyway imagine the pain and horror that they are going through. 'Glasgow and Scotland stands with you.' Former colleagues and friends in her hometown in County Cork, Ireland today remembered the 'beautiful, smiling' 24-year-old who was dedicated to helping the injured and sick. Her father, John, said yesterday that he, Miss Buckley's mother Marian and her brothers Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Friends and family have paid tribute to Karen Buckley - pictured with her brothers (l-r) Brendan, Damien and Kieran - after a four-day police search found her body yesterday . Her body was found at High Craigton farm after a huge search was launched to find her earlier this week . Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen’s former  school principal, Susan O’Keefe, said: ‘She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It’s sad. We are here on a fine summer’s day but Karen is not. We’re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.’ Karen was a ‘great all-rounder’, participating in ladies’ football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O’Keefe added. ‘At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009. 'A prayer service took place in the school this morning, with all students and staff of St. Mary's Secondary School in attendance. We offered prayers for Karen and her family at this difficult time.

'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'.

Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than £50,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching £50,001 - ten times the initial target of £5,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. Karen went missing from the Sanctuary nightclub not far from her home. Police initially searched a park in north-west Glasgow before switching their attention to a golf course and farm outside the city .

          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-16-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">The plastic surgeon who gave a 'Brazilian butt lift' to a young Australian tourist who died during the procedure lost another patient just a year before her tragic death, it has been revealed. The family of Evita Nicole Sarmonikas arrived back in Sydney on Tuesday from Mexico where they flew on a mission to bring her body home, after being pressured to have her remains created before an official autopsy could be carried out following her death in March this year. It has now been revealed Dr Victor Ramirez, of the Hospital Quirurgico del Valle in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California, operated on Roseann Falcon Ornelas in 2014. Australian woman Evita Nicole Sarmonikas died while undergoing plastic surgery last month in Mexico . The 52-year-old American woman was given a tummy tuck by Dr Ramirez, and began complaining of shortness of breath just five hours after her operation, and was in so much pain she could not move. Ms Ornelas sister Belinda Munoz told The ABC's 7 30 Report that she 'sat there in a mess of fluids and blood just oozing out of her body causing her to be soaked in bed. And yet the clinic associates refuse to change her bedding or help in any way.' Ms Munoz said that she wished she had spoken out about Dr Ramirez when her sister died, and that 'now the beautiful Evita is gone. My heart breaks for her family'. 29-year-old Evita Sarmonikas, from the Gold Coast, was admitted to Hospital Quirurgico del Valle on March 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend, and died on the same day. Her sister Andrea told 7 30 Report that the clinic in Mexicali attempted to convince Ms Sarmonikas boyfriend to have her body cremated before an official autopsy could be conducted. Her family insisted that an independent inquest into her death be arranged, and flew over to Mexico to collect her body. 'I knew I had to go over. I wasn't going to let her body leave without having a proper investigation,' Andrea told 7 30. Dr Ramirez lost another patient the year before Ms Sarmonikas died on his operating table . Ms Sarmonikas' sister Andrea told 7 30 Report that the clinic in Mexicali attempted to convince Ms Sarmonikas boyfriend to have her body cremated before an official autopsy could be conducted . Ms Sarmonikas's sister and her mother flew to Mexico to collect her body after an official autopsy . When Andrea and her grieving mother arrived in Mexico, they were handed paperwork that Ms Sarmonikas was meant to have filled out before surgery, and found that sections were incomplete. Ms Sarmonikas' sister said that the autopsy also highlighted discrepancies in the report prepared by the Mexican clinic. 'It's information that confirms this needs to be investigated seriously and that there are some irregularities that need to be clarified,' she said. The President of the College of Plastic Surgeons in Mexicali confirmed that Dr Ramirez's certification had lapsed, and that he had been stood down until after the investigation into Ms Sarmonikas' death had been completed. 'Currently, due to issues referring to our association's guidelines, statutes, and rules, he is temporarily suspended from duty,' Marco Antonio Gutierrez Lamadrid said. The Hospital Quirurgico del Valle has also been closed down amid dozens of reports of poor hygiene, outdated facilities and unsafe practices. An inspection also discovered inadequate operating theatres, insufficient post operative care and outdated medical devices, according to Proceso. The Australian Medical Association has warned Australians of the danger of travelling to developing countries to seek cosmetic surgery. The AMA's vice president Dr Stephen Parnis said that doctors would often see complications such as bleeding, wound breakdown, and wound complications in patients who underwent the procedures. Ms Saarmonikas died at the Hospital Quirurgico del Valle in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California . Andrea Sarmonikas said that the clinic's report revealed inconsistencies . The family of American woman Belinda Munoz, who died after being operated on by Dr Ramorez, said they wished they had spoken out after her death . 'What we see from time to time is things like infections, often with highly resistant bugs that we don't see in Australia,' Dr Parnis said. 'We have no information about the original procedure and it often makes it more difficult to care for that person in the absence of that vital medical information,' he said. Dr Parnis said that Australia had a 'world-class' level of care and that regulation was taken seriously. 'That often does not occur in other parts of the world. And that is important because that is an important check on the standards provided so that we can find if there is an adverse outcome and why it happens,' he said. A statement from Ms Sarmonikas' family released a statement urging other women not to 'risk death to improve on perfection'. 'The autopsy showed Eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery. The hospitals' only response was to cling to their waiver, removing themselves from any liability,' a family member wrote on the Facebook group. 'There have been no answers and their only offer of 'cooperation' was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes. The Australian Embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen,' the statement said. 'Evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment, as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody,' her family wrote. 'However the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest, and she deserves that.' Dr Victor Ramirez's name made headlines in 2012 after he used a photo of Kim Kardashian on a billboard to advertise his services . Tributes have poured in for Evita Nicole Sarmonikas (right, pictured with friend Sherri Burton) after her death in a Mexican hospital last week . Ms Sarmonikas's family did not at first say what procedure Evita was undergoing before she died but they explained: 'As beautiful as Evita was inside and out. She was still filled with certain inadequacies. As almost every woman on earth does.' 'Her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body,' they explained. 'She never demanded anything from anybody, but was always out giving her people. These near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle, and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals. 'These doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood. This emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion,' they Facebook post continued. Her sister Andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty. 'This was not the way to go home, no woman should risk death to improve on perfection,' they said. 'Tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself 'I am enough, I am worthy, I am perfect just the way I am'. 'Don't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison. Stop feeding an industry that hates humans, especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies. Do it for Eva, do it for you.' The doctor who performed the procedure, Dr Ramirez, made headlines in 2012 after he used a photo of the famously curvaceous reality star Kim Kardashian on a billboard to advertise his services. A Facebook tribute page has been set up for Evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to Australia . Tributes have also poured in from friends and family, vowing to remember her as a happy woman . The billboard was accompanied with the slogan 'No arriesgue su belleza, ni su salud', which translates as 'Don't risk your beauty or your health' - a bid to encourage people to visit a professional plastic surgeon instead of an unsafe one. Dr Ramirez's website says the ideal candidate for buttock augmentation surgery is someone with 'lack of volume of the buttocks'. 'Currently, the safest way to achieve the desired results through buttock augmentation is using silicone implants,' an outline of the procedure which takes 2 and a half hours reads. 'Although it might seem easy and economical, never allow anyone to inject substances that increase the volume of the buttocks through the injection of oily substances because the damage that they cause is irreversible due to the fact that the modelling agents cannot be extracted from your body and will generate serious problems the rest of your life.' The news comes after emotional tributes poured in for Ms Sarmonkias from friends and family. 'Eva my heart, my love, my joy. Where are you? I need you. We were meant to grow old together and still be conquering life hand in hand as sisters. I'm still not understanding. I haven't been able to sleep,' Sherri Burton wrote. Ms Burton recalled the last time the pair spoke, and the final day they spent together before Ms Sarmonkias went overseas. 'The last thing you wrote to me, about 7 hours before you went to be with our Heavenly Father, was "wish you were here with me". You always thought about me when you were having fun and wanted me to experience it. 'It has been 7 days since you were physically with me in this very room I’m typing in. Sitting on this very chair,' the tribute continued. 'Eva… There are not enough words to express how I feel about you. Thank you for loving me. I am honoured to have received such love. I am honoured to call you my sister. Ms Sarmonkias worked as a receptionist at LJ Hooker in Surfer's Paradise, and her former colleagues have remembered her as bubbly, bright and beautiful young woman. 'The LJ Hooker Surfers Paradise Network is deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing of one of our past employees Eva Sarmonikas,' a statement read. 'With the bubbliest and brightest personality anyone could ever imagine it was a pleasure to hear her wonderful voice at the other end of the line.</div></td></tr><tr>

It's hard to know just when the cherry blossoms will bloom in Japan each year, but in Kanazawa in the Ishikawa region of Japan, it's traditionally during the first half of the month of April.

There's far more to the Lone Star State than simply delicious barbecue - though we do recommend a visit to The Salt Lick restaurant in nearby Driftwood - such as these impossibly beautiful springtime blooms. They say that everything is bigger in Texas and the state's bluebonnets are no exception. The Texas Hill Country is a 25 county region in the Central and Southern part of the state, encompassing the capital city of Austin, and is known for its limestone and granite rocks. The area's famed bluebonnets generally start blooming in mid-March, continuing into April, and if you're lucky, you may even spot a calf . The area's famed bluebonnets generally start blooming in mid-March and continue into April, though there are plenty of other varieties of flowers that appear later in the season. In Burnet, Texas, which is known as the 'Bluebonnet Capital' by the state legislature, a festival takes place each year during the second weekend of April. Self-guided tours are available, though many travellers recommend simply stopping in to local cafes and shops and asking the owners where to go - no one knows the area better! Head to south central England for a glimpse of vivid daffodils, primroses, magnolias, and the area's signature delicate snowdrops . Cotswolds, England . Head to south central England in the spring for sightings of adorable baby lambs and vibrant wild daffodils, primroses and magnolias. For those looking for the area's signature snowdrops, consider a trip to the Painswick Rococo Garden, set in a hidden Cotswold valley with stunning countryside views. If you prefer bluebells, there are plenty of wooded areas blanketed with the popular flower in the region. Bluebells carpet the forest floor in Chedowrth Wood, located in the Chedowrth Nature Reserve in Gloucestershire . Head to Chedworth Nature Reserve in Gloucestershire in late April or early May to experience the vivid blues, or stop off at Standish Wood in the Cotswold Hills. Both are great for those looking to see England's famed carpets of bluebells and in Standish Wood, the Cotswold Way National Trail runs through the entire estate. Though the temperatures are warming up, April, in particular, is still quite rainy - this is England, after all - so prepare for your walks and excursions accordingly.</div></td></tr><tr>
          <td id="section-3-content-block-2-cell-4-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars">This is a shocking collection of harrowing photographs of the death and destruction visited on Armenians by Ottoman Turks a century ago that were taken by an American and a colleague who risked imprisonment to smuggle them out and show the world the full horror of what happened. John Elder and Armin T. Wegner both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a Turkish government which still denies the slaughter of up to 1.5million Armenians constituted genocide. As Armenians mark 100 years since the atrocities, many Western countries still do not use that word, and US president Barack Obama is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign. Scroll down for video . An image of a starving Armenian orphan taken by John Elder. More than 150,000 Armenian children were left parentless by the end of 1918 . Armenian deportees travel on foot in 1915 as taken by Armin Wegner, including women and children on an unpaved road in the desert sun . A crowd looks on as Armenians are hanged in the street in Constantinople before their forced removal to the desert had begun after April 1915 . This image was titled 'Abandoned and murdered small children of the (Armenian) deportees' by Wegner and was taken in 1915-1916 . Wegner, a volunteer military nurse, set up clandestine mail routes with foreign consulates and embassies to get many hundreds of notes, annotations, documents, letters and photographs of the Armenian deportation camps to Germany and the United States. He did so in defiance of strict orders from the Turkish and German authorities aimed at preventing any evidence of the horrors of the 'genocide' reaching the outside world. But his ruse was discovered and he was arrested by the German authorities and put to serve in cholera wards in Baghdad at the request of the Turkish command. There he fell seriously ill, and German-born Wegner left for Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in November 1916. Hidden in his belt were his photographic plates, and those of other German officers, with images of the Armenian massacre to which he had been a witness. His images, which along with Elder's were provided to MailOnline by the Washington DC-based Armenian National Institute, still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the 'genocide' today. In one, two Armenians are pictured hanging in the street in broad daylight in the capital Constantinople  while a crowd, including women and children, looks on. The image was taken in 1915 just before the mass deportation of Armenians to the desert had begun. Hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes in Anatolia and herded towards Syria.

Orphans of the massacre take a rest. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were forced from their homes in Anatolia and herded towards Syria . Three generations of the same family of refugees take shelter from the son in a makeshift tent. Many of those targeted for expulsion starved to death, were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers . Genocide is defined as the 'deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.' It was apparently coined by Polish-born US jurist Raphael Lemkin in his work 'Axis Rule in Occupied Europe' in reference to the Nazi extermination of the Jews. The word literally means 'killing a tribe' from the Greek 'genos' meaning 'race' or 'kind' Lemkin wrote that: 'It is intended to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.' Thanks to Lemkin's campaigning work, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948. The then two million strong Armenian minority were persecuted by a government suspicious that as Christians they were more loyal to Christian governments like that of Russia than they were to the Ottoman caliphate. Though they had thrived under Ottoman rule, despite being regarded as 'infidels' by their Muslim rulers, the Armenians were resented for their relative prosperity and success compared to many Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman government began their campaign in earnest after Armenians organized volunteer battalions to help the Russian army fight against the Turks in the Caucasus region. The Ottoman government used this as a justification to begin their forced 'removal' of Armenians the war zones along the Eastern Front in a bid to 'Turkify' what remained of a ailing empire. The deportation began following the rounding up of 235 Armenian leaders and intellectuals in the capital on April 24, 1915 - the anniversary of which is marked today. Many of those then targeted for expulsion starved to death, were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers. Another photograph shows the bodies of three murdered young boys lying in a gutter, one of them stripped naked, while two others look on. More than 150,000 Armenian children were left parentless by the end of the First World War. And in a third of Wegner's incredible images taken in 1915, a band of Armenian deportees, including a woman carrying a baby, children and elderly men, stagger through the desert along an unpaved road in the blazing suns towards their hellish new lives as refugees. Elder, from Pennsylvania, was a relief worker in the Armenian capital of Yerevan from 1917 to 1919. Refugees struggle to make their way along the Igdir road. The city was occupied in 1920 and is now part of a region of eastern Turkey . 'A 15-year-old child who died of starvation', according to Wegner, who took the image of the two bodies of young boys in 1915-1916 . Armenian deportees living in the open desert with bedding as their only shelter, though luckier families in the background have tents . He also painted a heartrending picture of the nightmare he witnessed using his camera. The divinity student defied instructions given to relief workers and other foreign personnel to evacuate the Caucasus, fearing that tens of thousands more Armenians would die of starvation if the relief programs were discontinued. He and fellow YMCA colleague James Arroll remained at their posts channeling relief fund to orphanages and soup kitchens. The pair were instrumental in providing care for thousands of Armenian orphans and arranging for the training and employment of 11,000 adults. Elder's pictures of orphans are particularly harrowing, some of them clearly starving with angular bones poking through the stretched skin of their shrunken bodies. In one eerie shot a human skeleton is pictured resting in a refugee graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in the background. In another refugees desperately forage for food by a railway track. In light of such evidence Obama's reticence to use the word 'genocide', in a bid to placate America's Turkish allies, has disappointed many. Several US officials said there had been a sharp internal debate over whether to use the 100-year anniversary to call the killings 'genocide' and make good on the president's campaign promise, particularly after Pope Francis used the term earlier this month.

Wegner describe the scene as 'Armenian deportees living in the open desert under makeshift tents.

Wegner captioned the image on the right: 'Fleeing from death. An Armenian mother on the heights of the Taurus Mountains whose husband has been killed' That comment by the Pope prompted an angry response from Turkey, which recalled its ambassador to the Vatican. Several European governments and parliaments are also expected to use the word in discussions of the events 100 years ago. The number of Armenians who died during this period is in fact only around 300,000, according to Turkey, which still blames 'war and disease' rather than a targeted programme of extermination by the Ottoman government. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, said at a press conference on Wednesday he 'would not want Obama to use the word "genocide" and would not expect such a thing.' The country's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu accused the European Parliament of 'enmity' against Turkey over its vote to use the term to describe the killings. In his formal statement on the anniversary he also insisted that Armenian losses were among many in the First World War and that it was a form of 'discrimination' to focus on Armenians and not on 'Turkish and Muslim Ottomans' who died at the same time. His words did not stop dozens of Armenians from gathering on Wednesday for an annual commemoration ceremony at a chasm at a site called Dudan, near the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey, where it is believed there is a mass grave to victims of the 'genocide'. Around 10,000 are thought to have been led here by Turkish military police in 1915 before being brutally murdered and thrown into the cleft in the rock.

Crowds cheered as Pema Lama, 15, was pulled, dazed and dusty, from the rubble of a guesthouse in Kathmandu after he became 'pancaked' between two floors when the quake hit on Saturday. He was carried out on a stretcher by medics who had placed  an IV drip into his arm and a blue brace around his neck. He appeared stunned and his eyes blinked in the sunlight. His astonishing tale of survival came as a four-month-old baby was reunited with his mother after being rescued from the rubble of their house. Scroll down for videos . Miracle survival: Pema Lama, 15, is rescued from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu five days after becoming trapped in the rubble during the devastating earthquake that struck the country on Saturday . Emergency medical attention: The boy was carried out in a stretcher. His face was covered in dust and medics had put an IV drop into his arm and a brace around his neck . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to free the trapped boy . The rescue was a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit on Saturday, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the poverty-stricken Himalayan nation . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to the 15-year-old boy from the seven-storey Hilton Guesthouse. Speaking shortly before he was rescued, Andrew Olvera, who was heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'He's not too far down. 'But the floors have collapsed and he'd pancaked between them.' Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors were hanging down in front like curtains. 'The whole operation is dangerous,' he said. 'But its risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.' The boy had been 'pancaked' between two floors, according to Andrew Olvera, who is heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development who freed him .

Meanwhile, the mother of a baby rescued after being trapped in rubble  has told over her 'overwhelming' joy at being reunited with her child. Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours. Today mother Rasmila Awal thanked 'God and the rescuers' for saving the infant from death. Mrs Awal, 35, tells MailOnline: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonish was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to reach him. Joy: Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours . Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their devastated house . Father Shyam Awal worked tirelessly with friends and neighbours to try to free the boy, digging with their bare hands through the rubble. But without the proper equipment it was impossible. The frantic mother could not sleep or eat throughout the 22-hour separation from her young son. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission. Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver told MailOnline: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' Now the family are homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their house. The once smart four-storey structure lies in ruins across the road. Rescued: This is the incredible moment that a four-month-old earthquake survivor was pulled alive from the rubble of his collapsed home following the 7.8-magnitude tremor which shattered Nepal . Saved: The baby boy, who emerged from the wreckage covered in dust, was miraculously found amid the devastation by rescue workers who heard the infant's faint cries . Second chance: The military search team had already scoured the area near to the child's home in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, in the hope of finding the little boy. But they had moved on after believing he had not survived . Team work: The military team then found the young boy when they returned to the area for the second time .

Another survivor who was trapped under rubble next to dead bodies for 82 hours has had one of his legs amputated, it was revealed today. Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu  when the 7.8-magnitude quake caused the building to crumble around him. He became trapped with his foot crushed under rubble and stayed alive by drinking his own urine. Doctors said they were forced to amputate a leg because of damage from prolonged internal bleeding. Their survival stories are a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the Himalayan nation. Today, rescuers toiled in pouring rain among the debris, but officials said the chance of finding any more survivors was bleak as the death toll neared 5,500. 'I was certain I was going to die': Rishi Khanal is carried out of a collapsed hotel in Kathmandu on a stretcher after being trapped under rubble for 82 hours following the earthquake that struck Nepal four days ago . Relief: Mr Khanal said he was surrounded by dead bodies. But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this brought a French rescue team that extracted him after an operation lasting many hours . While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 'There may not be any more survivors,' said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal's home ministry. 'The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.' Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared yesterday with protests outside parliament. Villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake had risen to 5,489 by Thursday morning. Almost 11,000 were injured, and more than 80 were also killed in neighbouring India and Tibet. Many people have been sleeping in the open after the quake - the United Nations has said 600,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Workers excavate bodies as they take part in a rescue operation at Kolache-2 in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu .

Lives ruined: People sort through the rubble of buildings which collapsed in Sathighar, north of Kathmandu . It has said eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. Dandal said foreign rescue teams had told him that their work is almost done because there is little chance of finding any survivors. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepali army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official. China is expected to send helicopters today, he said. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in. Nepalese soldiers use lime powder as a prevention measure against disease at a  tent site in Kathmandu .

That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the nation of 28 million people sandwiched between India and China. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Guna Raj, who works for a Kathmandu-based NGO specialising in providing sanitation, said there have been outbreaks of diarrhoea in relief camps because of a shortage of toilets and clean water. 'In the next few days or weeks I am sure there will be an outbreak of epidemics,' said Raj, who is involved in the relief effort. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by an avalanche on Tuesday. But at least two foreigners, whose nationalities were as yet unknown, were found dead, the home ministry said. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.</div></td></tr><tr>

The driver of the tractor-trailer that caused the massive pileup reportedly said he wished he was also killed in the fiery wreck, but it was no consolation to the students' grief-stricken families, friends and classmates who converged on Sweetheart Circle on campus for a candlelight vigil. GSU nursing students were the first to arrive, wearing their signature white lab coats, reported Atlanta Journal Constitution. They were followed by members of sororities that had lost sisters in the wreck. University President Dr Brooks Keel fought back tears as he addressed the swelling crowd of mourners on a breezy Georgia evening. 'Eagle Nation is a family,' he said, imploring the audience to hold on to each other and the love they have for one another. The girls' friends in the nursing program shared their personal memories of the deceased, like Caitlyn's funny text messages, Morgan's penchant for pink outfits and Abbie's prowess on the basketball court. The touching memorial service lasted 45 minutes and included a reading of the Nightingale Pledge- a modified Hippocratic Oath named after Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing famed for her exploits in the Crimean War. The somber event concluded with a candle-lighting ceremony. As a thousand tiny flames danced in the evening breeze at sunset, a cello player performed a mournful piece of music by Bach. Authorities said the driver responsible for the collission, identified as 55-year-old John Wayne Johnston, of Total Transportation LLC, failed to slow down while traveling on Interstate 16 near Savannah and plowed into stop-and-go traffic. The tractor-trailer slammed into an SUV, then rolled over a small passenger car that burst into flames, said Sgt. 1st Class Chris Nease of the Georgia State Patrol.

A Good Samaritan who stopped at the site of the  multi-vehicle collission and tried to rescue the victims said he briefly spoke to the driver of the truck. 'He said he wished he died too,' the witness told WSB-TV Thursday. St. Joseph's/ Candler Health System said the deceased students were commuting to St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah for their last day of clinical training of the school year. 'The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful,' Brooks Keel, president of Georgia Southern, said in a statement. 'Losing five students is almost incomprehensible.' The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged. The crash occurred at about 6am in Bryan County, about 20 miles west of Savannah. Traffic was heavy at that hour because an unrelated wreck about a mile ahead that forced motorists to slow, Nease said. 'Traffic was sort of stop-and-go when the tractor-trailer came along and struck one of the passenger vehicles in the rear,' Nease said. 'We're still trying to piece it all together. It's a terrible day.' The university said the students were all Georgia residents in their junior year. Students weep and hold lit candles during the Memorial Service on Sweetheart Circle .

Hospital officials said they were wrapping up clinical training for the year. 'You could tell they really loved what they did,' Sherry Danello, the hospital's chief nursing officer, said in a statement. 'They didn't just go through the task, they really connected to the patients.' The crash halted some motorists for more than six hours as road crews and tow trucks cleared the wreckage. Even when traffic began moving again, troopers kept a 6-mile stretch of eastbound I-16 closed as they investigated. Nease said the driver of the tractor-trailer, identified as John Johnson, from Shreveport, Louisiana, had not been cited as investigators worked to determine exactly what happened. Georgia authorities say it could take months before they decide whether to file criminal charges in the crash. Sgt. 1st Class Chris Nease, commander of the State Patrol Post investigating the crash, said Thursday he expects it will take several months for his team assigned to reconstruct the deadly crash to complete its report. Tom Durden, the district attorney for Bryan County where the collision occurred, said crash investigations can be complicated because it's not always obvious whether crimes were committed. 'There was no fog or smoke. It was clear as a bell,' said Sgt. Chris Rodewolt of the State Patrol. 'We did have heavy, heavy traffic.' Inferno: John Wayne Johnson's tractor-trailer plowed into traffic on Interstate 16, sparking a fiery pileup . Mangled: The five women, all of them juniors, were driving separately in two vehicles that were both mangled in the accident . Terrible accident: The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged . WSB-TV reported that Johnson was employed by Total Transportation, a large trucking company based in Mississippi boasting 900 drivers and nearly 750 vehicles. US Department of Transportation safety records indicate that Total Transportation drivers have received 266 citations for driving violations and 600 maintenance violations over the past two years. During the same time period, company vehicles have been involved in 85 crashes leading to 27 injuries. Total Transportation CEO John Stomps issued a statement saying his company was cooperating with the investigation. Two mangled passenger vehicles rested Wednesday at the bottom of an embankment beside the interstate. In front of them, just off the highway, was a tractor-trailer with its cab smashed into the back of a tanker truck. Georgia Southern University flew flags at half-staff on campus Thursday morning, and a tear has been added to the school's eagle mascot in remembrance of the tragedy. The student leadership of the Student Nurses' Association, Kappa Delta Sorority, Alpha Delta Pi Sorority and Alpha Omicron Pi Sorority have invited the Georgia Southern community to a memorial that will be held Thursday at 7pm on campus on Sweetheart Circle. In mourning: Flags fly at half-staff at Georgia Southern University on Thursday, while senior Katie Pursley, 21, shows a drawing of the school mascot, an eagle, with a tear to symbolize the grief of the university . It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of a tragedy that took place this morning. Several Georgia Southern students died and two were injured in an early morning crash on I-16 eastbound near Savannah. We are unable to release the names of these students at this time because we are awaiting notification to families. Every one of our students contributes in no small measure, to the Eagle Nation. The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful. Losing five students is almost incomprehensible. Our hearts go out to the families, friends and classmates of these students. The University flag will fly at half-staff Thursday in their memory. Memorial arrangements are pending. Let me urge those particularly touched by this tragedy to avail themselves of counseling services, and I urge all members of the University community to support each other during this time.
