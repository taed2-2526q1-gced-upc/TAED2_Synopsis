          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-1-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. "All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home » . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. "We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students," she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: "Five members." Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. "It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know," says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. "I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them." He pauses: "But you have to miss your country." The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. "Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education," says Touqan, the education minister. "We will not run a parallel system of education."

Four Australian troops have now died in the conflict in Afghanistan. The incident occurred in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province, where Taliban militants killed an Australian commando, the Australian Defence Ministry said. The 26-year-old commando -- Pvt. Luke Worsley of Sydney -- served with the Special Operations Task Group. This is the fourth Australian troop to die in the Afghan conflict. "The action in which Private Worsley died only concluded in the last few hours and was characterized by heavy, close quarter fighting. The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire," Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said "a significant number of Taliban insurgents were killed or captured as part of the operation. Taliban insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours." Gen. Carlos Branco, ISAF spokesman, said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. "However, we do know that the insurgents fired upon ISAF soldiers from the compound in which the Afghan civilians (two women and one child) were found after the fight. ISAF makes all effort to prevent losses of innocent civilian lives."  E-mail to a friend .</span><span>Taliban militants kill Australian commando in southern Afghanistan .

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-3-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Las Vegas has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, said Friday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. "We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition," Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. "The mother has cooperated with us," De Meo said. "We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl," he said. "It was very sad for her to find this out." A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.  Watch what's known about Stiles » . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a "survivalist type" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said. "Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."   The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. "Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,"  De Meo said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's "Nancy Grace" that Tuck was "racked by indecision" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, "He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter." "You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory," the attorney said.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-4-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday "following security concerns nearby," Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details "are still unfolding," and the threat "may or may not be" linked to the Saturday raid. "There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there," McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. "While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security," it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-5-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. "I very quickly realized two things," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. "One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change." "The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening." He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. "For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. "A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming," he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves," he said. "When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming." He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. "The Earth is always getting colder and warmer," he said. "It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet." Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. "We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred," he said. "What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming." Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. "We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it," he said. "We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty." The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. "Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said. "That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that."

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-6-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. "The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through," UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. "Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma." UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, "They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry." Redmond added, "These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state." While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. "We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels]," spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-7-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's "lives were just changed forever" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. "The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation," he said. Auman said the situation was "hard to fathom." "There's just no words to describe what we've been going through," he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. "We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken." Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was "engulfed" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved.  Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire » . Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. "If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina," Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. "I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff," Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. "The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal." Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control.  See the scenes of devastation » . George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see "the whole sky lit up." "The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet," he said. "I have never seen [a fire] move so fast." George Smith said the house's occupants were "partying in there yesterday and into the night." After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. "We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out," Sing said. "This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse." Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along North Carolina's southern coast. The year-round population of the 7-mile-long island is about 425, but it swells to about 25,000 during the summer season, according to the town's Web site.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-8-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>(CNN) -- This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran  is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-9-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>ALGIERS, Algeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with "no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives." The group called the operation "another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France." At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. "Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. "It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers," he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called "an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner." "The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community," Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. "I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car," he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-10-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. "People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them," says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. "They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path." A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. "I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother," she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. "No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!"  Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to "save my child" » . Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. "At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough," she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, "My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing." She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. "They took advantage of me," she says softly. "At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it." Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. "It's increasing," Suha says. "I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things." Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. "At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive," says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. "It's a taboo that no one is speaking about." She adds, "There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists." Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. "Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, "come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this." Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: "She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners." According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. "They took this path but they are not pleased," Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. "Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live." But she says, "I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this." Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. "It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood," she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. "I lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie."

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-12-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hours after declaring a state of emergency Saturday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered troops to take a television station's equipment and put a popular opposition leader under house arrest. President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were "for the good of Pakistan."  Watch Musharraf's speech » . There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated.  See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan » . Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported "negative" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000,  said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ.  Watch a former Pakistani P.M. call the developments in his country 'disturbing' » . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. "The situation is just unfolding," Rice said. "But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable." A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be "short-lived," and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. "I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly." Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest. Musharraf also had Khan placed under house arrest during a government crackdown in March 2006. Asked about Musharraf's actions Saturday, Khan said, "We are going to oppose this in every way." "None of us accept ... this whole drama about emergency." Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto -- who arrived in Karachi Saturday from Dubai, where she had gone to visit her family -- described a "wave of disappointment" at Musharraf's actions.  Watch crowds surround Bhutto upon her arrival » . Bhutto -- who returned to Pakistan last month after several years in exile -- wants to lift her Pakistan People's Party to victory in January's parliamentary election in the hope she can have a third term as prime minister. The nation's political atmosphere has been tense for months, with Pakistani leaders in August considering  a state of emergency because of the growing security threats in the country's lawless tribal regions. But Musharraf, influenced in part by Rice, held off on the move.  Watch a report on the volatile situation in Pakistan » .

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-14-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate "one way or the other" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear "intimate" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours » . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear "scene setting" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family "could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England," referring to Diana's son Prince William. "I'm hoping for justice," Al Fayed said outside court. "At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family." Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. "You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths," Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. "The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died." Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.

This moving image shows how police used software to unscramble the image. (Source: Interpol) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Interpol -- the international police agency based in Lyon, France. Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the man's identity or nationality. "We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens," Noble said. He said there is "very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children." Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. "The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly," said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-17-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. "Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys," Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. "Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source." James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. "We share the U.N.'s concerns," Appathurai told CNN. "Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation." He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. "The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government," Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. "Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations," the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. "You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future," he said.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-18-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the "genocide" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. "I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here," said Hoyer of Maryland. "I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is." Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. "More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future," they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at "a broad range of options" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. "We're confident that we'll find ways to do that," Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. "There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have." Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. "About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey," Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs.  See Incirlik's key location » . The U.S. military issued a "warning order" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

          <td id="section-2-content-block-2-cell-1-2-content-2-cell-19-1" ><div class="show-scrollbars"><span>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to "step aside," give up the "terror campaigns" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta "should step aside to make way for a unified Burma." "Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime," Bush said. "They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. "The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma," Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. "Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits," Bush warns. "We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. "The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now." The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a "need to start preparing for transition" for Myanmar. "We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition," he said.

Hosts Brazil beat Croatia 3-1 in the tournament's opening game .
Mexico beat Cameroon 1-0 in their opening match .
Brazil and Mexico are meeting for the fourth time at the World Cup. The Seleção have won their three previous meetings with a combined score of 11-0.
Brazil and Mexico met the last time the World Cup was held in Brazil, in the opening game of the 1950 edition at the Maracanã. The Seleção won 4-0.
Brazil and Mexico last met in the 2013 Confederations Cup, at the same venue as this game, the Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza. Luiz Felipe Scolari’s men won 2-0 thanks to goals from Neymar and Jô.
Mexico have only beaten the Seleção once on Brazilian soil. It was on October 31, 1968 in a friendly (2-1).
Mexico have only won one of their 11 games at the World Cup against South American sides (2-1 v Ecuador in 2002), drawing two and losing eight.
Luiz Felipe Scolari has faced Mexico once before at the World Cup. It was in charge of Portugal in the 2006 edition. His side won 2-1 in the group stages.
Neymar has scored 33 goals in only 50 appearances for Brazil and has six in his last four appearances for the Seleção.
Brazil have lost just one of their 34 World Cup matches in the first round/group stages of the World Cup since 1970 (W27 D6) – this came in a 1-2 defeat by Norway in their final group game of 1998 (but they had already qualified for the next stage).
The Seleção are now unbeaten in 38 successive matches in Brazil, with their last defeat coming against Paraguay (0-1in a friendly) in August 2002.
Oribe Peralta has scored nine goals in his last seven competitive appearances for Mexico, including the winner in the opening group stage game of this tournament.</span><span>As the 2014 World Cup continues, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture in Brazil from team news and key battles to betting odds and Opta stats...

Great expectations: Luiz Felipe Scolari oversees Brazil training in Fortaleza on Monday . VIDEO Hulk a doubt for Brazil . One to watch: Oscar . Brazil’s creator in chief was at his best against Croatia, scrapping in midfield, grabbing a goal and assist and playing a part in another goal. His tendency to drop deep makes him difficult to mark and his injury troubles in the second half of the season appear to have left him fresh to star for the Selecao. Key clash: Fred vs Rafael Marquez . Fred took some criticism for the way he went down against Croatia and Marquez will need to be wary not to get too close to the Brazil frontman whilst also making sure he does not provide a platform for Neymar to star again coming in from the left. A difficult job but one the four-time World Cup captain will relish. VIDEO Team Profile: Mexico . Key man: Brazil and Chelsea playmaker Oscar shone in the tournament opener against Croatia .

David Luiz will captain Brazil in Thiago Silva's absence due to suspension .
Joachim Low has no major injury concerns in his Germany squad .
Brazil have reached the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 2002, a year that they went on to lift the trophy.
The Seleção have lost none of their last six semi-final matches, winning five and drawing the other.As such, Brazil have advanced through to the final in each of their last six appearances in the final four; needing penalties just once (versus Holland in 1998).
Germany are the first country to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup in four consecutive tournaments.
However, they have reached the final just once (2002) in their previous three appearances at this stage.
This will be only the second meeting between these two nations at the World Cup.The first clash came in the 2002 final when Brazil won 2-0; with Ronaldo scoring both goals.
Since that 2002 final the two teams have met three times in all competitions, including in the 2005 Confederations Cup. They have won one match each with the other ending in a draw.
Their last meeting came in August 2011. Goals from Bastian Schweinsteiger, Andre Schurrle and Mario Gotze helped Germany to a 3-2 win. Neymar and Robinho netted for Brazil.
Brazil have scored in each of their last 10 clashes with Germany, averaging 2.2 goals per game.Neymar has scored four goals and assisted another in the 2014 World Cup; but will miss the rest of the tournament through injury.
The Barcelona forward has played a hand in 50% of Brazil’s 10 goals so far in the tournament.Brazil’s captain Thiago Silva will miss the semi-final through suspension. Brazil have lost none of their last 10 matches that he has featured in (W8 D2).
Eyes on the record: Miroslav Klose needs one more goal to be the all time leading World Cup goalscorer .
Silva’s replacement in the Brazil team is likely to be Bayern Munich defender Dante. The defender has played 151 times in the German Bundesliga for FC Bayern and Borussia Monchengladbach.
Dante is one of four players (two of which are goalkeepers) in the Brazil squad yet to play a minute at the 2014 World Cup.
No side have kept more clean sheets in the 2014 World Cup than Germany (3), while Brazil have only kept one in their five matches.
Brazil have won just one of their last four World Cup matches against UEFA opposition. That victory came in the Group Stages of this tournament against Croatia (D1 L2).
Germany’s only defeat in their last nine matches against South American opposition at the World Cup came in the 2002 final versus Brazil. They have won six and drawn two of the other eight.
Germany’s last six goals in the competition have been netted by six different players.
Only Thomas Muller (4) has scored more goals for Germany in this competition than centre-back Mats Hummels (2).
Both teams had to rely on goals from centre-halves to win their quarter-final match (Thiago Silva, David Luiz and Mats Hummels).
Against Colombia, Brazil conceded 31 fouls; more than the Seleção have conceded in any single World Cup game from 1966 onwards.
Miroslav Klose needs one goal to be the World Cup’s all-time leading scorer. He is currently joint-top with Ronaldo (15 goals).
The Lazio forward is the only player from either squad that was part of the 2002 final.</span><span>As the 2014 World Cup enters the closing stages, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture in Brazil from team news and key battles to betting odds and Opta stats... here is all the latest information ahead of the semi-final clash between hosts Brazil and Germany.

Venue: Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte . Kick-off: 9pm (5pm, Brazil time) TV coverage: ITV1, from 8:30pm . Odds: Brazil 17/10, Draw 11/5, Germany 9/5 . Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico) Managers: . Luiz Felipe Scolari (Brazil)Joachim Low (Germany) Job to do: Luiz Felipe Scolari's Brazil will have to try and make the final without Neymar . Team news: Luiz Felipe Scolari has several options to replace injured star man Neymar. Paulinho or Fernandinho could be asked to play a more advanced role now that regular midfielder Luis Gustavo is back from suspension. But the two biggest contenders to fill Neymar's position are Chelsea forward Willian or Shakhtar Donetsk's Bernard. Neither player has started a match for Brazil during the World Cup, but Willian has come off the bench in all but one of the team's matches. Bernard, a tricky, diminutive 21-year-old, has made two substitute appearances during the tournament. Brazil captain Thiago Silva will also miss out due to suspention and will be replaced by Dante with David Luiz taking the captain's armband. Germany coach Joachim Low has no such selection problems with only Shkodran Mustafi unavailable, yet he still does not seem to have found his first-choice starting XI. Philipp Lahm moved back to right-back in the quarter-final against France with Miroslav Klose making his first start up front, where Thomas Muller had previously been first choice. Mesut Ozil has struggled to deliver while Lukas Podolski no longer seems to figure in Low's plans. Key clash: Oscar (Brazil) v Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany) With Neymar injured Oscar will revert to his preferred No 10 role and he will be looking to constantly put pressure on Schweinsteiger who, despite being one of the world’s best midfielders, will have his questionable fitness tested by the Brazilian. VIDEO Team Profile: Brazil highlights . Key battle: Oscar will go up against Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield . One to watch: Marcelo (Brazil) The Real Madrid left-back has enjoyed a good tournament for the Selecao, but that could come to a crashing halt against Philipp Lahm. Germany's Mr Versatile, Lahm has been deployed as a holding midfielder and at right-back during the tournament, though Joachim Low is expected to opt for the latter in a bid to stop Marcelo's rampaging runs down that side.

The use of an incorrect date of birth to search a police database may have missed an offence potentially linked to an individual. An individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist offence. It has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance.
An individual who was wanted for an offence committed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted. The origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police believed they were only searching for pre-1998 offences and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 offence when informing the Northern Ireland Office that the individual was 'not wanted by the PSNI'.

A review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made. Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way so-called ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run. Critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA's Hyde Park bombing in 1982. David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Tony Blair's Labour government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. Lady Justice Hallett said the scheme was not well publicised, and effectively kept 'below the radar', but was not secret. 'The administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty,' she said. 'Suspected terrorists were not handed a 'get out of jail free card'.' But shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made. They included: . The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters. Democratic Unionist First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when Mr Cameron ordered the review. A police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked, though only by intelligence, to 295 murders during the Troubles. Today Mr Robinson said the scheme was ‘wrong in principle and shambolic in practice’. He added: ‘Of course it was a get out of jail free card for Downey. 'It has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that Lady Justice Hallett refers to as in error, it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out. ‘And indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge.’ Northern Ireland's most senior police officer said it was 'highly unlikely' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases. Chief constable George Hamilton said he accepted Lady Justice Hallett's findings and apologised to the Hyde Park victims. He said: 'The difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place.' He added: 'If they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application (to collapse the case) would be successful as it was in the Downey case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it.' Under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein, before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status. A report on each individual was sent back to the Government and, if they were declared as not being wanted, a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals. In the Commons today, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'I know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity (Hyde Park) and I apologise again on behalf of this Government for any hurt that has caused.' She added: 'I fully accept the Hallett Report's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the Government will act on them. 'But, as I have said before, as far as this Government is concerned, the OTR scheme is over.' For . more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park . hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.</span></div></td></tr><tr>

Office furniture maker Steelcase surveyed more than 2,000 people in countries to identify nine new postures .
The Draw – Technology (small and mobile) allows people to pull back from their desks while they use it. They recline, signaling they’re contemplating or absorbing information and draw the device closer to their body to maintain an optimal focal length.
The Multi-Device - This posture is representative of how people adapt to multitasking on multiple-devices. One hand holding a phone to the ear, the other tasking on a laptop. The result is a forward lean that is a symbol of concentration and an orientation to the smaller screen of a laptop.
The Text - Smartphones are small compared to other forms of technology and, therefore, require unique postures. Workers bring arms in close as keying and gesturing are performed.
The Cocoon - People recline, bring up their feet onto the seat, and draw their smartphone or tablet close, resting on their thighs. The result is a cocoon - small mobile technology allows people to remain productive in this posture.
The Swipe - This posture results when the device is used on a work surface in 'surfing mode', in which people operate the device with one hand, typically with swiping gestures. Because it’s on a work surface, a person must keep their head a certain distance above the tablet in order to see it, and position their head to look down at it.
The Smart Lean - This posture is the result of mobile devices that create the desire for people to temporarily 'pull away' from others without leaving a meeting or collaborative environment. This is typically a temporary posture and used for glancing at incoming texts or e-mails.
The Trance - This posture was observed when people were focused on the screen and either mousing or using a touchpad to navigate on the screen for extended periods of time. This is a long duration posture.
The Take It In - In this posture, people recline to view content on the large display and/or sit back to contemplate. This posture is about 'taking in' information rather than generating it.
The Strunch .
- The 'strunch' (stretched-out hunch) is a very common posture with .
laptops. As people become fatigued, they gradually push their laptop .
further from the edge of the worksurface, resting their weight on the .
surface.  This causes them to reach forward to work. Since the back and .
neck cannot sustain the reach and hunch posture for a long time, the .
person begins to prop themselves up with their non- tasking arm.</span><span>By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:45 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 26 February 2013 . Laptops, tablets and smartphones have dramatically changed the way we work - and even the way we sit, researchers have claimed. A new study has found that most desks, designed for traditional 'desktop' computers, have meant we have created a range of new ways to sit. They range from 'the cocoon', where people hunch up on their chair to be close to their phone, to 'the smart lean', used to  check emails during a meeting. The nine new workplace postures: These new ways of sitting and slouching to fit ourselves around new mobile computing technology have been identified by research from office furniture company Steelcase . Smartphones and tablet computers, small and light enough to be grasped in the hands, have liberated workers from postural slavery to our digital overseers. Now new research has shown that the change in the ways we deal with technology in the workplace is indeed changing the way that we sit and slouch while we're earning our keep. A survey of 2,000 office workers in 11 countries undertaken by office furniture maker Steelcase has identified nine new postures which have emerged in response to the new technologies we interact with. They are: . Contorting to fit: Office workers have hitherto been kept in postural bondage to the immobile machines they interact with to earn their keep . The new postures identified were a result of using small, mobile technology such as smartphones, tablets and laptops and new workplace behaviours. However, with furniture poorly adapted to these new ways of sitting and slouching, Steelcase notes, they frequently cause pain and long-term injuries, disrupting concentration and creativity. James Ludwig, vice president of global design for Steelcase, said: 'We love our technology – it’s become a ubiquitous extension of ourselves. 'But the way technology impacts our bodies as we work has been largely ignored.' Based on this research, Steelcase has designed a new chair – Gesture – that moves with the body and supports the user throughout the different postures.  It will be available in the UK later this year.</span></div></td></tr><tr>

New signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos set to feature for Champions League winners Real Madrid .
The winner of the last 11 European Super Cups has alternated between the reigning Champions League winners and the reigning UEFA Cup/Europa League winners. With Bayern Munich winning last season, Sevilla must win the 2014 edition for this trend to continue.
Real Madrid are the only team to lose a European Super Cup to a golden goal; they were beaten 2-1 by Galatasaray in 2000.
The last UEFA Super Cup to feature two teams from the same country also featured Sevilla; they beat Barcelona 3-0 in the 2006 edition.
Sevilla were also the last Spanish side to lose this game; they were beaten 3-1 by Milan in 2007. The last four Spanish sides to qualify for this competition have won.
Real Madrid have won only one of their three previous European Super Cups. They were beaten in 1998 and 2000 before beating Feyenoord 3-1 in 2002. Iker Casillas started the 2000 and 2002 games.
The last 13 La Liga meetings between Real Madrid and Sevilla have seen 64 goals scored; an average of just under five per game.
The Whites have won nine of their last 11 meetings with the Andalusian side in all competitions, but have lost the last two away from the Bernabeu (both away league games).
The one previous clash in a major European competition came in the 1958 European Cup quarter-final. Los Merengues won 8-0 at home before drawing 2-2 away to progress.
Welshman Gareth Bale scored two goals and assisted two more in two league appearances against Sevilla last season.
Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 16 goals in nine La Liga games against Sevilla; he has scored more goals against them than any other side in the competition.
James Rodriguez could make his first competitive appearance for Real Madrid in this game. He scored six goals in five World Cup 2014 appearances, collecting the Golden Boot in the process.

75% of men always have orgasms during sex, but only 30% of women do .
Taking turns is more practical, says leading sex expert Tracey Cox .
'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator'
Get him to have an orgasm first and make the 'together' orgasm the second one. Most men find they have much better control second time around.
Ignore the old advice of getting him to think about big pants or count backwards. The aim is distraction but it simply doesn't work. New research shows even as he's manically saying '459, 458' in his brain, another part is saying 'What does he think I am, stupid? As if this is going to grab my attention when I've got a pair of breasts bobbling in front of me, my penis is nestled in a nice, warm, sexy place, my girlfriend's moaning and throwing her head back and….'
Use the bridge manoeuvre: This is the technique most sex therapists recommend. The basic idea is to give you clitoral stimulation up to the point of, but not actually to, orgasm and let his thrusting trigger off the orgastic reflex. This effectively provides a 'bridge' between clitoral stimulation and intercourse.
Choose the right position. Woman on top or him from behind are the most likely positions to stimulate the front vaginal wall and up your chances of a penetrative orgasm.
Talk lots, telling each other exactly where you're at by using a number system. Groaning out a 'Nine!' or delivering a curt 'Still two' might seem odd to start, but it's a quick and effective way to communicate in bed.
Switch stimulation regularly. Not only will it keep you both hovering rather than climbing steadily toward a climax, it stops sex becoming too orgasm focused. Change positions. Change rooms. Change the CD. Anything to change the mood, keeping it hot and sexy but maintaining a measure of control.
Make friends with her vibrator. If you asked me the best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm, this would be it. One of you holding a wand vibrator (slim, cylindrical, non-intrusive) over the clitoral area during penetrative sex is the most effective way to ensure a shared orgasm experience.</span><span>By . Tracey Cox . Are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time? The myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' in unison, it's going to hang on there for some time yet. The reality is, you'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together. Let's take a look at the facts. Roughly 75% of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to 30% of women. Men's orgasms last around 5-10 seconds (if he's lucky), women's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more (much more, if she's lucky and he's adept). Do the math and you'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely. Romantic, yes. Likely, no. Quite frankly, taking turns - you have your orgasm first, he has his later - is not only more practical, it's sometimes a lot more satisfying. Having an orgasm is a selfish experience: you're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure. Having to pay attention to your partner's bits to guarantee they're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment doesn't enhance the experience, it interferes with it . For men, this is less of a problem. Their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered, continue. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through. While he's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy, we're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment. Yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through .

Vicente Del Bosque are the current holders of the World Cup .
Chile and Australia are the two other sides in Group B .
This is the first time the two World Cup finalists have met in the tournament directly after contesting the final since 1990, when West Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in the final (after meeting each other in 1986).
La Roja lost their opening game of the 2010 World Cup to Switzerland, but went on to become the first team to ever win the tournament having lost their first game.
Vicente Del Bosque has only lost one of his 25 World Cup games as Spain head-coach, including qualifiers (W22 D2). That was against Switzerland (0-1) in 2010.
David Villa - Spain’s top scorer at World Cup Finals (eight goals) - has been directly involved in seven of Spain’s last nine goals in the tournament (six goals, one assist).
Spain have won their last six World Cup games, their best ever run in the tournament. Their last four games have ended in 1-0 wins.
Spain have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four World Cup games, the longest current run. Indeed only Italy (five games in 1990) and Switzerland (five in 2006 & 2010) have ever had a longer run in the competition.
Holland have made it past the group stages in their last seven previous World Cup participations.
Robin van Persie was the top scorer in the 2014 European World Cup qualifiers (11 goals).
Spain and Holland have a perfectly even head-to-head record with four wins apiece and one draw, though Spain won the only previous World Cup clash 1-0 in the 2010 final.
The defending champions have only won their first game in three of the last 10 World Cups (D4 L3), with Italy drawing 1-1 with Paraguay last time out.

After weeks of chasing the story, Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton discovers Cardiff have sent a dossier to the FA, claiming former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and Crystal Palace Sporting Director Iain Moody had exchanged ‘racist, sexist and homophobic’ texts and email messages. With the final piece of his investigation falling into place, Lawton contacts all parties for comments.
Sky Sports News reports that Mackay, who was expected to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager, has pulled out of the running to replace Tony Pulis.
Moody’s lawyers attempt unsuccessfully to stop the Daily Mail from publishing the allegations.
The Daily Mail publishes the exclusive story. Shortly after, former Cardiff City midfielder Ibrahim Farah takes to Twitter to label Mackay ‘disgusting’ and to complain about his treatment at the hands of Mackay.
Moody resigns from his role at Crystal Palace.
Leading football figures and anti-bigotry campaigners welcome the story, and call for swift action if allegations are substantiated.
Early in the evening, Mackay’s agent speaks to Sky Sports News, saying the former Cardiff manager is shocked by the allegations and will fight them.
Later in the evening, the League Managers Association issues an apology on Mackay’s behalf. Mackay denies allegations he is a racist and claims only ‘two’ of the text messages in question were sent by him. The ill-judged statement tries to dismiss the sordid exchanges between the two men as ‘friendly text banter’.
Twitter responds by pouring scorn on the statement, with prominent former footballers Jason Roberts and Stan Collymore leading the criticism.
Sportsmail publishes further details, with Lawton pointing out that, contrary to Mackay’s claims, the former Cardiff manager was reponsible for both racist and homophobic texts.
Rio Ferdinand publicly criticises the LMA as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘insensitive’.
The LMA apologises for its previous statement, conceding that ‘some of its wording’ was ‘inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature’.
Cardiff officials question Mackay’s assertion that he was only responsible for two offensive texts and express horror at the LMA’s choice of words. Cardiff also call for the LMA’s chief executive Richard Bevan to resign.
Sportsmail publishes further Textgate revelations from Lawton, with Mackay accused of calling the Cardiff owner Vincent Tan a ‘chink’.</span><span>Sportmsmail's Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton broke the story of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody's text exchange.

Taking probiotic supplements can be effective in reducing the occurrence and duration of sore throats, coughs and colds among children.  According to a study in the European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, pre-school youngsters who took a chewable ProVen Fit For School blackcurrant-flavour tablet had less severe symptoms and, as a result, needed fewer days off. The tablets are suitable for four- to 16-year-olds.
It pays to volunteer, especially as you get older, because it staves off depression. Officials at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto examined 73 studies published over 45 years that looked at adults aged 50-plus in formal volunteering roles. They found that those who helped out had reduced symptoms of depression, better overall health and lived longer. Researchers, whose findings were published online in Psychological Bulletin, said that between two and three hours a week was the optimal amount to volunteer.</span><span>TV presenter Davina McCall is gearing up to release a book on how she has successfully banished sugar from her diet . She's known for her bestselling workout DVDs – and now TV presenter Davina McCall is gearing up to release a book on how she has successfully banished sugar from her diet. The recipe book, Five Weeks To Sugar Free, will be published in January to capitalise on the good intentions of people making New Year resolutions. Davina, right, says: ‘Every time I pick up a magazine, I read another horrifying fact about sugar. I was a committed sugar addict until I managed to stop for three years, only to take it up again with gusto. This book shows you how I finally quit but still get to eat lovely puddings.’ The book will be the first of three, and if it’s anything like Davina’s hugely popular workout DVDs, which trade on her attainable image as a busy mother of three, it should be a huge hit. Taking probiotic supplements can be effective in reducing the occurrence and duration of sore throats, coughs and colds among children .</span></div></td></tr><tr>

The TV show ‘Great British Bake Off’ has captured the imagination of the nation and highlighted the joys of baking .</span><span>By . Toni Jones . PUBLISHED: . 09:29 EST, 16 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:26 EST, 16 October 2012 . Tonight's grand final of the Great British Bake Off is expected to draw over four million viewers. Not bad for a genteel BBC2 show about cakes. The show has become one of BBC2’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc and judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry whip up a TV storm. The show has been credited with making baking cool again, and reminding boys where the kitchen is (tonight's final is all male and judge Paul Hollywood's heartthrob status continues to soar). But Brtiain's love of baking isn't really new at all - just ask your grandmother. The trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century . From the launch of Good Housekeeping magazine in the 1920s to the introduction of TV chefs post-Coronation in the 1950s, the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends. Today's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking, and in the 1980s celebrity chef Delia Smith stirred our passions for the kitchen with her 'How to Cook' book. Factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s, rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s. To celebrate National Baking Week (which runs from 15th-21st October) and the Great British Bake Off final kitchen appliance company Kenwood has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from Wendy Wilson, archivist from Britain's oldest weekly women's magazine The Lady, and Dr Valerie Mars, a food historian. Dr Mars says: 'Baking trends are essentially uneven. Some people will always bake, especially in places with a long-standing tradition such as Yorkshire, but fashion also has a huge influence. In the current economic climate, an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times.' Bake Off judge and trained baker Paul Hollywood seen today ahead of the final . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Good Housekeeping magazine in 1932 focused on 'meals for the business girl' The popularity of new domestic appliances in the 1950s led to a rise in the trend for home baking . In the seventies the rise of the middle class meant that dinner parties became popular . Delia Smith, celebrity chef and Norwich fan lured us back in to the kitchen in the nineties with her back to basics approach . 4 million viewers are expected to watch finalists John Waite, James Morton and Brendan Lynch battle it out for the Great British Bake Off crown tonight in front of judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc .</span></div></td></tr><tr>

Make an effort with the  in-laws. Aunt Betty might drive you crazy, but getting along will make your partner feel at ease.
Offer to help. If you see your partner is stressed, suggest you take on some more tasks. Be proactive.
Accept that Christmas  and relationships are never perfect. Lower your expectations and accept  that most of the time, it’s  the effort that counts.
Say I love you. It helps.
Start a deep debate when you have been drinking. It  will only lead to tears and unnecessary arguments.
Bring up past problems. Regurgitating previous relationship issues is likely  to taint memories of the entire festive period.
Complain about how much everything costs. Christmas  is expensive but it creates lasting happy memories, so spoil yourselves a bit.
Forget that human contact can say everything, whether holding hands or cuddling on the sofa. Touching is crucial.
Forget to spend quality time together, especially when your house is full of relatives. Let relatives look after the kids while you and your partner go for a walk.
Let issues build up. If you are feeling neglected, ask your partner for a hug  and calmly explain how you feel. Don’t blow up in a tantrum or sulk.</span><span>A family Christmas can bring a great deal of stress  – from the marathon cooking and endless washing-up to disappointment over gifts and heated family rows.
