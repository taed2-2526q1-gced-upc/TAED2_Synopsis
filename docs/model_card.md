# Model Card for {synopsis/bart-large-cnn-lora-news-summarizer}

This model is a fine-tuned version of facebook/bart-large-cnn specifically optimized for news article summarization, designed to extract and highlight the most key points from scraped news articles from an URLs.

## Model Details

### Model Description

This model builds upon Facebook's BART-large-cnn trained with the CNN Daily Mail, a large-scale dataset of news articles paired with multi-sentence summaries. It has been fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a small learning rate for better generalization to identify and extract the most critical information from news content, producing concise summaries that capture the essential points while maintaining accuracy and coherence. The fine-tuning process uses ROUGE scores as an evaluation metric to ensure that summaries remain relevant and concise.

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

This model is designed for summarizing news articles with focus on extracting and highlighting the most key points. It can be used directly for text summarization of news content from web scraping applications. Some uses include summarizing news articles from given URLs, creating quick digests for journalists, researchers, and readers or powering news aggregation platforms or browser extensions.

### Downstream Use [optional]

The model can be integrated into news aggregation platforms, content management systems, and automated summarization pipelines that require efficient processing of scraped news articles. It can also be used for assisting accessibility tools by providing short summaries.

### Out-of-Scope Use

This model should not be used for generating original content, summarizing non-news text, or processing languages other than English. Performance may degrade on highly technical (legal contracts, medical papers) or specialized content outside the news domain. It is also not designed for dection misinformation.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model inherits biases present in the CNN Daily Mail training data and may reflect temporal biases from the training period. Generated summaries should be validated for factual accuracy, especially for critical news applications. The model performs best on general news content and may omit contextually important details in the interest of brevity.

### Recommendations

Users should double-check summaries for critical use cases and consider human validation for sensitive or high-impact content.
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.

```
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", "synopsis/bart-large-cnn-lora-news-summarizer")

article = "Your news article here..."

summary = summarizer(article, max_length=200, min_length=50, do_sample=False)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])

```

## Training Details

### Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

The model was initially trained on the CNN Daily Mail dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a curated collection of news articles with corresponding summaries focused on key point extraction. The fine-tuning dataset includes diverse news categories to improve generalization across different types of news content.

### Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->
News articles were cleaned and normalized, removing advertisements and non-content elements. Articles were tokenized using the BART tokenizer with a maximum sequence length of 1024 tokens.

#### Preprocessing [optional]

- Training regime: Mixed precision (fp16)
- Learning rate: 3e-5
- Batch size: 8 with gradient accumulation
- Training epochs: 3-5

## Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card if possible. -->

Evaluation performed on held-out news articles from various sources and categories not seen during training.

#### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->

Performance evaluated across different news categories (politics, business, technology, sports) and article lengths.

#### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

Primary evaluation metrics include ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L scores for summary quality. BLEU scores and human evaluation for coherence and factuality.

### Results

The model achieves competitive summarization performance with improved key point extraction compared to the base facebook/bart-large-cnn model. Specific metrics will be updated after evaluation completion.

#### Summary

Fine-tuning on news-specific data improves the model's ability to identify and extract key points while maintaining the strong baseline performance of the original BART model.
